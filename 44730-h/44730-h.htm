    Every one knows that the fine phrase “God geometrizes” is
    attributed to Plato, but few know where this famous passage
    is found, or the exact words in which it was first expressed.
    Those who, like the author, have spent hours and even days in
    the search of the exact statements, or the exact references,
    of similar famous passages, will not question the timeliness
    and usefulness of a book whose distinct purpose it is to
    bring together into a single volume exact quotations, with
    their exact references, bearing on one of the most
    time-honored, and even today the most active and most
    fruitful of all the sciences, the queen-mother of all the
    sciences, that is, mathematics.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    It is hoped that the present volume will prove indispensable
    to every teacher of mathematics, to every writer on
    mathematics, and that the student of mathematics and the
    related sciences will find its perusal not only a source of
    pleasure but of encouragement and inspiration as well. The
    layman will find it a repository of useful information
    covering a field of knowledge which, owing to the unfamiliar
    and hence repellant character of the language employed by
    mathematicians, is peculiarly inaccessible to the general
    reader. No technical processes or technical facility is
    required to understand and appreciate the wealth of ideas
    here set forth in the words of the world’s great thinkers.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    No labor has been spared to make the present volume worthy of
    a place among collections of a like kind in other fields. Ten
    years have been devoted to its preparation, years, which if
    they could have been more profitably, could scarcely have
    been more pleasurably employed. As a result there have been
    brought together over one thousand more or less familiar
    passages pertaining to mathematics, by poets, philosophers,
    historians, statesmen, scientists, and mathematicians. These
    have been gathered from over three hundred authors, and have
    been

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_vi"
      id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>

    grouped under twenty heads, and
    cross indexed under nearly seven hundred topics.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    The author’s original plan was to give foreign quotations
    both in the original and in translation, but with the growth
    of material this plan was abandoned as infeasible. It was
    thought to serve the best interest of the greater number of
    English readers to give translations only, while preserving
    the references to the original sources, so that the student
    or critical reader may readily consult the original of any
    given extract. In cases where the translation is borrowed the
    translator’s name is inserted in brackets [] immediately
    after the author’s name. Brackets are also used to indicate
    inserted words or phrases made necessary to bring out the
    context.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    The absence of similar English works has made the author’s
    work largely that of the pioneer. Rebière’s “Mathématiques et
    Mathématiciens” and Ahrens’ “Scherz und Ernst in der
    Mathematik” have indeed been frequently consulted but rather
    with a view to avoid overlapping than to receive aid. Thus
    certain topics as the correspondence of German and French
    mathematicians, so excellently treated by Ahrens, have
    purposely been omitted. The repetitions are limited to a
    small number of famous utterances whose absence from a work
    of this kind could scarcely be defended on any grounds.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    No one can be more keenly aware of the shortcomings of a work
    than its author, for none can have so intimate an
    acquaintance with it. Among those of the present work is its
    incompleteness, but it should be borne in mind that
    incompleteness is a necessary concomitant of every collection
    of whatever kind. Much less can completeness be expected in a
    first collection, made by a single individual, in his leisure
    hours, and in a field which is already boundless and is yet
    expanding day by day. A collection of great thoughts, even if
    complete today, would be incomplete tomorrow. Again, if some
    authors are quoted more frequently than others of greater
    fame and authority, the reason may be sought not only in the
    fact that the writings of some authors peculiarly lent
    themselves to quotation, a quality singularly absent in other
    writers of the greatest merit and authority, but also in
    this, that the greatest freedom has been exercised in the
    choice of selections. The author has followed

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_vii"
      id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>

    the bent of his own fancy in
    collecting whatever seemed to him sufficiently valuable
    because of its content, its beauty, its originality, or
    its terseness, to deserve a place in a “Memorabilia.”</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Great pains has been taken to furnish exact readings and
    references. In some cases where a passage could not be traced
    to its first source, the secondary source has been given
    rather than the reputed source. For the same reason many
    references are to later editions rather than to inaccessible
    first editions.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    The author feels confident that this work will be of
    assistance to his co-workers in the field of mathematics and
    allied fields. If in addition it should aid in a better
    appreciation of mathematicians and their work on the part of
    laymen and students in other fields, the author’s foremost
    aim in the preparation of this work will have been achieved.</p>

    <em>Quantity is that which is

    laws</em>. Both operator and operand must derive their
    meaning from the laws of operation. In the case of
    ordinary algebra these are the three laws already
    indicated [the commutative, associative, and distributive
    laws], in the algebra of quaternions the same save the law
    of commutation for multiplication and division, and so on.
    It may be questioned whether this definition is
    sufficient, and it may be objected that it is vague; but
    the reader will do well to reflect that any definition

    The critical mathematician has
    abandoned the search for truth. He no longer flatters
    himself that his propositions are or can be known to him
    or to any other human being to be true; and he contents
    himself with aiming at the correct, or the consistent. The
    distinction is not annulled nor even blurred by the
    reflection that consistency contains immanently a kind of
    truth. He is not absolutely certain, but he believes
    profoundly that it is possible to find various sets of a
    few propositions each such that the propositions of each
    set are compatible, that the propositions of each such set
    imply other propositions, and that the latter can be
    deduced from the former with certainty. That is to say, he
    believes that there are systems of coherent or consistent

    Mathematics, from the earliest
    times to which the history of human reason can reach, has
    followed, among that wonderful people of the Greeks, the
    safe way of science. But it must not be supposed that it
    was as easy for mathematics as for logic, in which reason
    is concerned with itself alone, to find, or rather to make
    for itself that royal road. I believe, on the contrary,
    that there was a long period of tentative work (chiefly
    still among the Egyptians), and that the change is to be
    ascribed to a <em>revolution</em>, produced by the happy
    thought of a single man, whose experiments pointed
    unmistakably to the path that had to be followed, and
    opened and traced out for the most distant times the safe
    way of a science. The history of that intellectual
    revolution, which was far more important than the passage
    round the celebrated Cape of Good Hope, and the name of
    its fortunate author, have not been preserved to us.... A
    new light flashed on the first man who demonstrated the
    properties of the isosceles triangle (whether his name was
    <em>Thales</em> or any other name), for he found that he had
    not to investigate what he saw in the figure, or the mere
    concepts of that figure, and thus to learn its properties;
    but that he had to produce (by construction) what he had
    himself, according to concepts <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
    priori</i>, placed
    into that figure and represented in it, so that, in order
    to know anything with certainty <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
    priori</i>, he must
    not attribute to that figure anything beyond what
    necessarily follows from what he has himself placed into
    it, in accordance with the concept.—<span class=

    Thought-economy is most highly
    developed in mathematics, that science which has reached
    the highest formal development, and on which natural
    science so frequently calls for assistance. Strange as it
    may seem, the strength of mathematics lies in the
    avoidance of all unnecessary thoughts, in the utmost
    economy of thought-operations. The symbols of order, which
    we call numbers, form already a system of wonderful
    simplicity and economy. When in the multiplication of a
    number with several digits we employ the multiplication
    table and thus make use of previously accomplished results
    rather than to repeat them each time, when by the use of
    tables of logarithms we avoid new numerical calculations
    by replacing them by others long since performed, when we
    employ determinants instead of carrying through from the
    beginning the solution of a system of equations, when we
    decompose new integral expressions into others that are
    familiar,—we see in all this but a faint reflection of the
    intellectual activity of a <em>Lagrange</em> or
    <em>Cauchy</em>, who with the keen discernment of a military
    commander marshalls a whole troop of completed operations
    in the execution of a new one.—<span class="smcap">Mach,

    Mathematics accomplishes
    really nothing outside of the realm of magnitude;
    marvellous, however, is the skill with which it masters
    magnitude wherever it finds it. We recall at once the
    network of lines which it has spun about heavens and
    earth; the system of lines to which azimuth and altitude,
    declination and right ascension, longitude and latitude
    are referred; those abscissas and ordinates, tangents and
    normals, circles of curvature and evolutes; those
    trigonometric and logarithmic functions which have been
    prepared in advance and await application. A look at this
    apparatus is sufficient to show that mathematicians are
    not magicians, but that everything is accomplished by
    natural means; one is rather impressed by the multitude of
    skilful machines, numerous witnesses of a manifold and

    Let us now declare the means
    whereby our understanding can rise to knowledge without
    fear of error. There are two such means: intuition and
    deduction. By intuition I mean not the varying testimony
    of the senses, nor the deductive judgment of imagination
    naturally extravagant, but the conception of an attentive
    mind so distinct and so clear that no doubt remains to it
    with regard to that which it comprehends; or, what amounts
    to the same thing, the self-evidencing conception of a
    sound and attentive mind, a conception which springs from
    the light of reason alone, and is more certain, because
    more simple, than deduction itself....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    It may perhaps be asked why to intuition we add this other
    mode of knowing, by deduction, that is to say, the process
    which, from something of which we have certain knowledge,
    draws consequences which necessarily follow therefrom. But we
    are obliged to admit this second step; for there are a great
    many things which, without being evident of themselves,
    nevertheless bear the marks of certainty if only they are
    deduced from

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_16"
      id="Page_16">16</a></span>

    true and incontestable
    principles by a continuous and uninterrupted movement of
    thought, with distinct intuition of each thing; just as we
    know that the last link of a long chain holds to the
    first, although we can not take in with one glance of the
    eye the intermediate links, provided that, after having
    run over them in succession, we can recall them all, each
    as being joined to its fellows, from the first up to the
    last. Thus we distinguish intuition from deduction,
    inasmuch as in the latter case there is conceived a
    certain progress or succession, while it is not so in the
    former;... whence it follows that primary propositions,
    derived immediately from principles, may be said to be
    known, according to the way we view them, now by
    intuition, now by deduction; although the principles
    themselves can be known only by intuition, the remote

    It is now necessary to
    indicate more definitely the reason why mathematics not
    only carries conviction in itself, but also transmits
    conviction to the objects to which it is applied. The
    reason is found, first of all, in the perfect precision
    with which the elementary mathematical concepts are
    determined; in this respect each science must look to its
    own salvation.... But this is not all. As soon as human
    thought attempts long chains of conclusions, or difficult
    matters generally, there arises not only the danger of
    error but also the suspicion of error, because since all
    details cannot be surveyed with clearness at the same
    instant one must in the end be satisfied with a
    <em>belief</em> that nothing has been overlooked from the
    beginning. Every one knows how much this is the case even
    in arithmetic, the most

           use of mathematics. No
    one would imagine that the higher parts of mathematics
    fare better in this respect; on the contrary, in more
    complicated conclusions the uncertainty and suspicion of
    hidden errors increases in rapid progression. How does
    mathematics manage to rid itself of this inconvenience
    which attaches to it in the highest degree? By making
    proofs more rigorous? By giving new rules according to
    which the old rules shall be applied? Not in the least. A
    very great uncertainty continues to attach to the result
    of each single computation. But there are checks. In the
    realm of mathematics each point may be reached by a
    hundred different ways; and if each of a hundred ways
    leads to the same point, one may be sure that the right
    point has been reached. A calculation without a check is
    as good as none. Just so it is with every isolated proof
    in any speculative science whatever; the proof may be ever
    so ingenious, and ever so perfectly true and correct, it
    will still fail to convince permanently. He will therefore
    be much deceived, who, in metaphysics, or in psychology
    which depends on metaphysics, hopes to see his greatest
    care in the precise determination of the concepts and in
    the logical conclusions rewarded by conviction, much less
    by success in transmitting conviction to

    others. Not only must the
    conclusions support each other, without coercion or
    suspicion of subreption, but in all matters originating in
    experience, or judging concerning experience, the results
    of speculation must be verified by experience, not only

    the conclusion. Thus, if I could form a triangle, the
    three sides of which were accurately mathematical lines, I

    opposite to the facts of the case; that mathematical

    new ideas, and new methods, not capable of being defined
    by any form of words, but springing direct from the
    inherent powers and activities of the human mind, and from
    continually renewed introspection of that inner world of
    thought of which the phenomena are as varied and require
    as close attention to discern as those of the outer
    physical world (to which the inner one in each individual
    man may, I think, be conceived to stand somewhat in the
    same relation of correspondence as a shadow to the object
    from which it is projected, or as the hollow palm of one

    The actual evolution of
    mathematical theories proceeds by a process of induction
    strictly analogous to the method of induction employed in
    building up the physical sciences; observation,
    comparison, classification, trial, and generalisation are
    essential in both cases. Not only are special results,
    obtained independently of one another, frequently seen to
    be really included in some generalisation, but branches of
    the subject which have been developed quite independently
    of one another are sometimes found to have connections
    which enable them to be synthesised in one single body of
    doctrine. The essential nature of mathematical thought
    manifests itself in the discernment of fundamental
    identity in the mathematical aspects of what are
    superficially very different domains. A striking example
    of this species of immanent identity of mathematical form
    was exhibited by the discovery of that distinguished
    mathematician ... Major MacMahon, that all possible Latin
    squares are capable of enumeration by the consideration of
    certain differential operators. Here we have a case in
    which an enumeration, which appears to be not amenable to
    direct treatment, can actually be carried out in a simple
    manner when the underlying identity of the operation is
    recognised with that involved in certain operations due to
    differential operators, the calculus of which belongs
    superficially to a wholly different region of thought from
    that relating to Latin squares.—<span class=

    studies; while the truth is,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_28"
      id="Page_28">28</a></span>

    that; from the most elementary
    mathematical notion that arises in the mind of a child to
    the farthest verge to which mathematical investigation has
    been pushed and applied, this power is in constant
    exercise. By observation, as here used, can only be meant
    the fixing of the attention upon objects (physical or
    mental) so as to note distinctive peculiarities—to
    recognize resemblances, differences, and other relations.
    Now the first mental act of the child recognizing the
    distinction between <em>one</em> and more than one, between
    <em>one</em> and <em>two</em>, <em>two</em> and <em>three</em>,
    etc., is exactly this. So, again, the first geometrical
    notions are as pure an exercise of this power as can be
    given. To know a straight line, to distinguish it from a
    curve; to recognize a triangle and distinguish the several
    forms—what are these, and all perception of form, but a
    series of observations? Nor is it alone in securing these
    fundamental conceptions of number and form that
    observation plays so important a part. The very genius of
    the common geometry as a method of reasoning—a system of
    investigation—is, that it is but a series of observations.
    The figure being before the eye in actual representation,
    or before the mind in conception, is so closely
    scrutinized, that all its distinctive features are
    perceived; auxiliary lines are drawn (the imagination
    leading in this), and a new series of inspections is made;
    and thus, by means of direct, simple observations, the
    investigation proceeds. So characteristic of common
    geometry is this method of investigation, that Comte,
    perhaps the ablest of all writers upon the philosophy of
    mathematics, is disposed to class geometry, as to its
    method, with the natural sciences, being based upon
    observation. Moreover, when we consider applied
    mathematics, we need only to notice that the exercise of
    this faculty is so essential, that the basis of all such
    reasoning, the very material with which we build, have
    received the name <em>observations</em>. Thus we might
    proceed to consider the whole range of the human
    faculties, and find for the most of them ample scope for
    exercise in mathematical studies. Certainly, the
    <em>memory</em> will not be found to be neglected. The very
    first steps in number—counting, the multiplication table,
    etc., make heavy demands on this power; while the higher
    branches require the memorizing of formulas which are
    simply appalling to the uninitiated. So the
    <em>imagination</em>, the creative faculty of the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_29"
      id="Page_29">29</a></span>

    mind, has constant exercise in
    all original mathematical investigations, from the
    solution of the simplest problems to the discovery of the
    most recondite principle; for it is not by sure,
    consecutive steps, as many suppose, that we advance from
    the known to the unknown. The imagination, not the logical
    faculty, leads in this advance. In fact, practical
    observation is often in advance of logical exposition.
    Thus, in the discovery of truth, the imagination
    habitually presents hypotheses, and observation supplies
    facts, which it may require ages for the tardy reason to
    connect logically with the known. Of this truth,
    mathematics, as well as all other sciences, affords
    abundant illustrations. So remarkably true is this, that
    today it is seriously questioned by the majority of
    thinkers, whether the sublimest branch of mathematics,—the
    <em>infinitesimal calculus</em>—has anything more than an
    empirical foundation, mathematicians themselves not being
    agreed as to its logical basis. That the imagination, and
    not the logical faculty, leads in all original
    investigation, no one who has ever succeeded in producing
    an original demonstration of one of the simpler
    propositions of geometry, can have any doubt. Nor are
    <em>induction</em>, <em>analogy</em>, the
    <em>scrutinization</em> of <em>premises</em> or the
    <em>search</em> for them, or the <em>balancing</em> of
    <em>probabilities</em>, spheres of mental operations foreign
    to mathematics. No one, indeed, can claim pre-eminence for
    mathematical studies in all these departments of
    intellectual culture, but it may, perhaps, be claimed that
    scarcely any department of science affords discipline to
    so great a number of faculties, and that none presents so
    complete a gradation in the exercise of these faculties,
    from the first principles of the science to the farthest
    extent of its applications, as mathematics.—<span class=

    The opinion appears to be
    gaining ground that this very general conception of
    functionality, born on mathematical ground, is destined to
    supersede the narrower notion of causation, traditional in
    connection with the natural sciences. As an abstract
    formulation of the idea of determination in its most
    general sense, the notion of
    functionality includes and transcends

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_30"
      id="Page_30">30</a></span>

    the more special
    notion of causation as a one-sided determination of future
    phenomena by means of present conditions; it can be used
    to express the fact of the subsumption under a general law
    of past, present, and future alike, in a sequence of
    phenomena. From this point of view the remark of Huxley
    that Mathematics “knows nothing of causation” could only
    be taken to express the whole truth, if by the term
    “causation” is understood “efficient causation.” The
    latter notion has, however, in recent times been to an
    increasing extent regarded as just as irrelevant in the
    natural sciences as it is in Mathematics; the idea of
    thorough-going determinancy, in accordance with formal
    law, being thought to be alone significant in either
    domain.—<span class="smcap">Hobson, E. W.</span></p>

    diophantine theorems of Fermat, left without proof by
    their author, which resisted all efforts of the
    myriad-minded Euler to reduce to demonstration, and only
    yielded up their cause of being when turned over in the
    blow-pipe flame of Gauss’s transcendent genius; or the
    doctrine of double periodicity, which resulted from the
    observation of Jacobi of a purely analytical fact of
    transformation; or Legendre’s law of reciprocity; or
    Sturm’s theorem about the roots of equations, which, as he
    informed me with his own lips, stared him in the face in
    the midst of some mechanical investigations connected (if
    my memory serves me right) with the motion of compound
    pendulums; or Huyghen’s method of continued fractions,
    characterized by Lagrange as one of the principal
    discoveries of that great mathematician, and to which he
    appears to have been led by the construction of his
    Planetary Automaton; or the new algebra, speaking of which

    mathematics as a whole and the numerous analogies in its
    different departments. We also notice that, the farther a
    mathematical theory is developed, the more harmoniously
    and uniformly does its construction proceed, and
    unsuspected relations are disclosed between hitherto

    which is attainable, to restrict our hopes to that of
    which accomplishment, if not immediately practicable,

    But it is precisely mathematics, and the pure
    science generally, from which the general educated public and
    independent students have been debarred, and into which they
    have only rarely attained more than a very meagre insight. The
    reason of this is twofold. In the first place, the ascendant
    and consecutive character of mathematical knowledge renders its
    results absolutely insusceptible of presentation to persons who
    are unacquainted with what has gone before, and so necessitates
    on the part of its devotees a thorough and patient exploration
    of the field from the very beginning, as distinguished from
    those sciences which may, so to speak, be begun at the end, and
    which are consequently cultivated with the greatest zeal. The
    second

    reason is that, partly through the
    exigencies of academic instruction, but mainly through the
    martinet traditions of antiquity and the influence of
    mediæval logic-mongers, the great bulk of the
    elementary text-books of mathematics have unconsciously assumed
    a very repellant form,—something similar to
    what is termed in the theory of protective mimicry in biology
    “the terrifying form.” And it is
    mainly to this formidableness and touch-me-not character of
    exterior, concealing withal a harmless body, that the undue
    neglect of typical mathematical studies is to be
    attributed.—<span class="smcap">McCormack, T. J.</span></p>

    Mathematics in gross, it is plain, are a grievance

    touched with nothing but strict reasoning. Mathematical proofs
    are out of the reach of topical arguments; and are not to be

    <b><a name="Block_272" id="Block_272">272</a>.</b>
    The belief that mathematics, because it is
    abstract, because it is static and cold and gray, is detached
    from life, is a mistaken belief. Mathematics, even in its
    purest and most abstract estate, is not detached from life. It
    is just the ideal handling of the problems of life, as
    sculpture may idealize a human figure or as poetry or painting
    may idealize a figure or a scene. Mathematics is precisely the
    ideal handling of the problems of life, and the central ideas
    of the science, the great concepts about which its stately
    doctrines have been built up, are precisely the chief ideas
    with which life must always deal and which, as it tumbles and
    rolls about them through time and space, give it its interests
    and problems, and its order and rationality. That such is the
    case a few indications will suffice to show. The mathematical
    concepts of constant and variable are represented familiarly in
    life by the notions of fixedness and change. The concept of
    equation or that of an equational

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_36"
      id="Page_36">36</a></span>

    system, imposing
    restriction upon variability, is matched in life by the concept
    of natural and spiritual law, giving order to what were else
    chaotic change and providing partial freedom in lieu of none at
    all. What is known in mathematics under the name of limit is
    everywhere present in life in the guise of some ideal, some
    excellence high-dwelling among the rocks, an
    “ever flying perfect” as Emerson
    calls it, unto which we may approximate nearer and nearer, but
    which we can never quite attain, save in aspiration. The
    supreme concept of functionality finds its correlate in life in
    the all-pervasive sense of interdependence and mutual
    determination among the elements of the world. What is known in
    mathematics as transformation—that is,
    lawful transfer of attention, serving to match in orderly
    fashion the things of one system with those of
    another—is conceived in life as a process of
    transmutation by which, in the flux of the world, the content
    of the present has come out of the past and in its turn, in
    ceasing to be, gives birth to its successor, as the boy is
    father to the man and as things, in general, become what they
    are not. The mathematical concept of invariance and that of
    infinitude, especially the imposing doctrines that explain
    their meanings and bear their names—What are
    they but mathematicizations of that which has ever been the
    chief of life’s hopes and dreams, of that
    which has ever been the object of its deepest passion and of
    its dominant enterprise, I mean the finding of the worth that
    abides, the finding of permanence in the midst of change, and
    the discovery of a presence, in what has seemed to be a finite
    world, of being that is infinite? It is needless further to
    multiply examples of a correlation that is so abounding and
    complete as indeed to suggest a doubt whether it be juster to
    view mathematics as the abstract idealization of life than to
    regard life as the concrete realization of
    mathematics.—<span class="smcap">Keyser, C. J.</span></p>

    is a silent world, and, nevertheless, in respect to the highest
    principle of art—the interpenetration of
    content and form, the perfect fusion of mode and
    meaning—it even surpasses music. In a sense,
    it is a static world, but so, too, are the worlds of the
    sculptor and the architect. The figures, however, which reason
    constructs and the mathematic vision beholds, transcend the

    abiding things in a world of flux, configurations that remain

    it reverently, for all intellection whatsoever, whether of
    demon or man or deity. It is there that mind as mind attains
    its highest estate, and the condition of knowledge there is the

    It is curious to observe how differently these
    great men [Plato and Bacon] estimated the value of every kind
    of knowledge. Take Arithmetic for example. Plato, after
    speaking slightly of the convenience of being able to reckon
    and compute in the ordinary transactions of life, passes to
    what he considers as a far more important advantage. The study
    of the properties of numbers, he tells us, habituates the mind
    to the contemplation of pure truth, and raises us above the
    material universe. He would have his disciples apply themselves
    to this study, not that they may be able to buy or sell, not
    that they may qualify themselves to be
    shop-keepers or travelling merchants,

    to withdraw their minds from the ever-shifting spectacle of
    this visible and tangible world, and to fix them on the
    immutable essences of things.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Bacon, on the other hand, valued this branch of knowledge only
    on account of its uses with reference to that visible and
    tangible world which Plato so much despised. He speaks with
    scorn of the mystical arithmetic of the later Platonists, and
    laments the propensity of mankind to employ, on mere matters of
    curiosity, powers the whole exertion of which is required for
    purposes of solid advantage. He advises arithmeticians to leave
    these trifles, and employ themselves in framing convenient
    expressions which may be of use in physical
    researches.—<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>

    Those who assert that the mathematical sciences

    fair, however, the most important species are order and

    The great truths with which it [mathematics] deals,
    are clothed with austere grandeur, far above all purposes of
    immediate convenience or profit. It is in them that our limited
    understandings approach nearest to the conception of that
    absolute and infinite, towards which in most other things they
    aspire in vain. In the pure mathematics we contemplate absolute
    truths, which existed in the divine mind before the morning
    stars sang together, and which will continue to exist there,
    when the last of their radiant host shall have fallen from
    heaven. They existed not merely in metaphysical possibility,
    but in the actual contemplation of the supreme reason. The pen
    of inspiration, ranging all nature and life for imagery to set

    Doubtless the reasoning faculty, the mind, is the
    leading and characteristic attribute of the human race. By the
    exercise of this, man arrives at the properties of the natural
    bodies. This is science, properly and emphatically so called.
    It is the science of pure mathematics; and in the high branches
    of this science lies the truly sublime of human acquisition. If
    any attainment deserves that epithet, it is the knowledge,
    which, from the mensuration of the minutest dust of the
    balance, proceeds on the rising scale of material bodies,
    everywhere weighing, everywhere measuring, everywhere detecting
    and explaining the laws of force and motion, penetrating into
    the secret principles which hold the universe of God together,
    and balancing worlds against worlds, and system against system.
    When we seek to accompany those who pursue studies at once so
    high, so vast, and so exact; when we arrive at the discoveries
    of Newton, which pour in day on the works of God, as if a
    second <em>fiat</em> had gone forth from his own mouth; when,
    further, we attempt to follow those who set out where Newton
    paused, making his goal their starting-place, and, proceeding
    with demonstration upon demonstration, and discovery upon
    discovery, bring new worlds and new systems of worlds within
    the limits of the known universe, failing to learn all only
    because all is infinite; however we may say of man, in
    admiration of his physical structure, that “in form and moving
    he is express and admirable,” it is here, and here without
    irreverence, we may exclaim, “In apprehension how like a god!”
    The study of the pure mathematics will of course not be
    extensively pursued in an institution, which, like this
    [Boston Mechanics’ Institute], has a direct practical tendency
    and aim. But it is still to be remembered, that pure
    mathematics lie at the foundation of mechanical philosophy,
    and that it is ignorance only which can speak or think of
    that sublime science as useless research or barren
    speculation.—<span class="smcap">Webster, Daniel.</span></p>

    The school of Plato has advanced the interests of
    the race as much through geometry as through philosophy. The
    modern engineer, the navigator, the astronomer, built on the
    truths which those early Greeks discovered in their purely
    speculative investigations. And if the poetry, statesmanship,
    oratory, and philosophy of our day owe much to
    Plato’s divine Dialogues, our commerce, our
    manufactures, and our science are equally indebted to his Conic
    Sections. Later instances may be abundantly quoted, to show
    that the labors of the mathematician have outlasted those of
    the statesman, and wrought mightier changes in the condition of
    the world. Not that we would rank the geometer above the

  <p class="v2">
    <b><a name="Block_401" id="Block_401">401</a>.</b>
    Mathematics because of its nature and structure is
    peculiarly fitted for high school instruction
    [Gymnasiallehrfach]. Especially the higher mathematics, even if
    presented only in its elements, combines within itself all
    those qualities which are demanded of a secondary subject. It
    engages, it fructifies, it quickens, compels attention, is as
    circumspect as inventive, induces courage and self-confidence
    as well as modesty and submission to truth. It yields the
    essence and kernel of all things, is brief in form and
    overflows with its wealth of content. It discloses the depth
    and breadth of the law and spiritual element behind the surface
    of phenomena; it impels from point to point and carries within
    itself the incentive toward progress; it stimulates the
    artistic perception, good taste in judgment and execution, as
    well as the scientific comprehension of things. Mathematics,
    therefore, above all other subjects, makes the student lust
    after knowledge, fills him, as it were, with a longing to
    fathom the cause of things and to employ his own powers
    independently; it collects his mental forces and concentrates
    them on a single point and thus awakens the spirit of
    individual inquiry, self-confidence and the joy of doing; it
    fascinates because of the view-points which it offers and
    creates certainty and assurance, owing to the universal
    validity of its methods. Thus, both what he receives and what
    he himself contributes toward the proper conception and
    solution of a problem, combine to mature the student and to
    make him skillful, to lead him away from the surface of things
    and to exercise him in the perception of their essence. A
    student thus prepared thirsts after knowledge and is ready for
    the university and its sciences. Thus it appears, that higher
    mathematics is the best guide to philosophy and to the
    philosophic conception of the world (considered as a
    self-contained whole) and of one’s own
    being.—<span class="smcap">Dillmann, E.</span></p>

    These Disciplines [mathematics] serve to inure and
    corroborate the Mind to a constant Diligence in Study; to
    undergo the Trouble of an attentive Meditation, and cheerfully
    contend with such Difficulties as lie in the Way. They wholly
    deliver us from a credulous Simplicity, most strongly fortify
    us against the Vanity of Scepticism, effectually restrain from
    a rash Presumption, most easily incline us to a due Assent,
    perfectly subject us to the Government of right Reason, and
    inspire us with Resolution to wrestle against the unjust
    Tyranny of false Prejudices. If the Fancy be unstable and
    fluctuating, it is to be poised by this Ballast, and steadied
    by this Anchor, if the Wit be blunt it is sharpened upon this
    Whetstone; if luxuriant it is pared by this Knife; if
    headstrong it is restrained by this Bridle; and if dull it is

    sensible Matter, distinctly views pure Forms, conceives the
    Beauty of Ideas, and investigates the Harmony of Proportions;
    the Manners themselves are sensibly corrected and improved, the
    Affections composed and rectified, the Fancy calmed and

    commonest modes of loose thought, and sources of error both in
    opinion and in practice, is to overlook the importance of
    quantities. Mathematicians and chemists are taught by the whole
    course of their studies, that the most fundamental difference
    of quality depends on some very slight difference in
    proportional quantity; and that from the qualities of the
    influencing elements, without careful attention to their

    In mathematics I can report no deficience, except
    it be that men do not sufficiently understand the excellent use
    of the Pure Mathematics, in that they do remedy and cure many
    defects in the wit and faculties intellectual. For if the wit
    be too dull, they sharpen it; if too wandering, they fix it; if

    Nor do I know any study which can compete with

    Mathematics, among all school subjects, is
    especially adapted to further clearness, definite brevity and
    precision in expression, although it offers no exercise in
    flights of rhetoric. This is due in the first place to the
    logical rigour with which it develops thought, avoiding every
    departure from the shortest, most direct way, never allowing
    empty phrases to enter. Other subjects excel in the development
    of expression in other respects: translation from foreign
    languages into the mother tongue gives exercise in finding the
    proper word for the given foreign word and gives knowledge of
    laws of syntax, the study of poetry and prose furnish fit
    patterns for connected presentation and elegant form of
    expression, composition is to exercise the pupil in a like
    presentation of his own or borrowed thoughts

    and their development, the natural sciences teach description of
    natural objects, apparatus and processes, as well as the
    statement of laws on the grounds of immediate sense-perception.
    But all these aids for exercise in the use of the mother
    tongue, each in its way valuable and indispensable, do not
    guarantee, in the same manner as mathematical training, the
    exclusion of words whose concepts, if not entirely wanting, are
    not sufficiently clear. They do not furnish in the same measure
    that which the mathematician demands particularly as regards
    precision of expression.—<span class="smcap">Reidt, F.</span></p>

    One rarely hears of the mathematical recitation as
    a preparation for public speaking. Yet mathematics shares with
    these studies [foreign languages, drawing and natural science]
    their advantages, and has another in a higher degree than
    either of them.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Most readers will agree that a prime requisite for healthful
    experience in public speaking is that the attention of the
    speaker and hearers alike be drawn wholly away from the speaker
    and concentrated upon the thought. In perhaps no other
    classroom is this so easy as in the mathematical, where the
    close reasoning, the rigorous demonstration, the tracing of
    necessary conclusions from given hypotheses, commands and
    secures the entire mental power of the student who is
    explaining, and of his classmates. In what other circumstances
    do students feel so instinctively that manner counts for so
    little and mind for so much? In what other circumstances,
    therefore, is a simple, unaffected, easy, graceful manner so
    naturally and so healthfully cultivated? Mannerisms that are
    mere affectation or the result of bad literary habit recede to
    the background and finally disappear, while those peculiarities
    that are the expression of personality and are inseparable from
    its activity continually develop, where the student frequently
    presents, to an audience of his intellectual peers, a connected
    train of reasoning....</p>

    One striking peculiarity of mathematics is its

    within that limited range of knowledge it is possible to set
    him exercises as real and as interesting as the propositions
    themselves which he has studied; deductions which might have

    Would you have a man reason well, you must use him

    better than mathematics, which therefore, I think should be
    taught to all who have the time and opportunity, not so much to
    make them mathematicians, as to make them reasonable creatures;
    for though we all call ourselves so, because we are born to it
    if we please, yet we may truly say that nature gives us but the
    seeds of it, and we are carried no farther than industry and
    application have carried us.—<span class=

    Secondly, the study of mathematics would show them
    the necessity there is in reasoning, to separate all the

    lay by those which relate not to the proposition in hand, and
    wholly to leave them

    out of the reckoning. This is that
    which, in other respects besides quantity is absolutely
    requisite to just reasoning, though in them it is not so easily
    observed and so carefully practised. In those parts of
    knowledge where it is thought demonstration has nothing to do,
    men reason as it were in a lump; and if upon a summary and
    confused view, or upon a partial consideration, they can raise
    the appearance of a probability, they usually rest content;
    especially if it be in a dispute where every little straw is
    laid hold on, and everything that can but be drawn in any way
    to give color to the argument is advanced with ostentation. But
    that mind is not in a posture to find truth that does not
    distinctly take all the parts asunder, and, omitting what is
    not at all to the point, draws a conclusion from the result of

    and that serve him well enough in his ordinary course. A man in

    understanding, yet in many things, and those very visible, it
    may fail him. This would take off that presumption that most

    together to arrive at general propositions, and simply desire
    to know how to deal with my general propositions when I get
    them, and how to deduce right inferences from them; it is clear
    that I shall obtain this sort of discipline best in those
    departments of thought in which the first principles are
    unquestionably true. For in all

    our thinking, if we come
    to erroneous conclusions, we come to them either by accepting
    false premises to start with—in which case
    our reasoning, however good, will not save us from error; or by
    reasoning badly, in which case the data we start from may be
    perfectly sound, and yet our conclusions may be false. But in
    the mathematical or pure sciences,—geometry,
    arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, the calculus of variations
    or of curves,—we know at least that there is
    not, and cannot be, error in our first principles, and we may
    therefore fasten our whole attention upon the processes. As
    mere exercises in logic, therefore, these sciences, based as
    they all are on primary truths relating to space and number,
    have always been supposed to furnish the most exact discipline.
    When Plato wrote over the portal of his school.
    “Let no one ignorant of geometry enter
    here,” he did not mean that questions relating to
    lines and surfaces would be discussed by his disciples. On the
    contrary, the topics to which he directed their attention were
    some of the deepest problems,—social,
    political, moral,—on which the mind could
    exercise itself. Plato and his followers tried to think out
    together conclusions respecting the being, the duty, and the
    destiny of man, and the relation in which he stood to the gods
    and to the unseen world. What had geometry to do with these
    things? Simply this: That a man whose mind has not undergone a
    rigorous training in systematic thinking, and in the art of
    drawing legitimate inferences from premises, was unfitted to
    enter on the discussion of these high topics; and that the sort
    of logical discipline which he needed was most likely to be
    obtained from geometry—the only mathematical
    science which in Plato’s time had been
    formulated and reduced to a system. And we in this country
    [England] have long acted on the same principle. Our future
    lawyers, clergy, and statesmen are expected at the University
    to learn a good deal about curves, and angles, and numbers and
    proportions; not because these subjects have the smallest
    relation to the needs of their lives, but because in the very
    act of learning them they are likely to acquire that habit of
    steadfast and accurate thinking, which is indispensable to
    success in all the pursuits of
    life.—<span class="smcap">Fitch, J. C.</span></p>

    It is admitted by all that a finished or even a
    competent reasoner is not the work of nature alone; the
    experience of every day makes it evident that education
    develops faculties which would otherwise never have manifested
    their existence. It is, therefore, as necessary to <em>learn to
    reason</em> before we can expect to be able to reason, as it is
    to learn to swim or fence, in order to attain either of those
    arts. Now, something must be reasoned upon, it matters not much
    what it is, provided it can be reasoned upon with certainty.
    The properties of mind or matter, or the study of languages,
    mathematics, or natural history, may be chosen for this
    purpose. Now of all these, it is desirable to choose the one
    which admits of the reasoning being verified, that is, in which
    we can find out by other means, such as measurement and ocular
    demonstration of all sorts, whether the results are true or
    not. When the guiding property of the loadstone was first
    ascertained, and it was necessary to learn how to use this new
    discovery, and to find out how far it might be relied on, it
    would have been thought advisable to make many passages between
    ports that were well known before attempting a voyage of
    discovery. So it is with our reasoning faculties: it is
    desirable that their powers should be exerted upon objects of
    such a nature, that we can tell by other means whether the
    results which we obtain are true or false, and this before it
    is safe to trust entirely to reason. Now the mathematics are
    peculiarly well adapted for this purpose, on the following
    grounds:</p>
  <p class="v1">
    1. Every term is distinctly explained, and has but one meaning,
    and it is rarely that two words are employed to mean the same
    thing.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    2. The first principles are self-evident, and, though derived
    from observation, do not require more of it than has been made
    by children in general.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    3. The demonstration is strictly logical, taking nothing for
    granted except self-evident first principles, resting nothing
    upon probability, and entirely independent of authority and
    opinion.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    4. When the conclusion is obtained by reasoning, its truth or
    falsehood can be ascertained, in geometry by actual
    measurement, in algebra by common arithmetical calculation. This

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_61"
      id="Page_61">61</a></span>

    gives confidence, and is absolutely necessary, if, as was said
    before, reason is not to be the instructor, but the pupil.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    5. There are no words whose meanings are so much alike that the
    ideas which they stand for may be confounded. Between the
    meaning of terms there is no distinction, except a total
    distinction, and all adjectives and adverbs expressing
    difference of degrees are
    avoided.—<span class="smcap">De Morgan, Augustus.</span></p>

    incorporate mathematical truths. If language imitates the voice
    of the Creator, revealing His heart, mathematics discloses His
    intellect, repeating the story of how things came into being.
    And the value of mathematics, appealing as it does to our

    Mathematics in its pure form, as arithmetic,
    algebra, geometry, and the applications of the analytic method,
    as well as mathematics applied to matter and force, or statics
    and dynamics, furnishes the peculiar study that gives to us,
    whether as children or as men, the command of nature in this

    Mathematics gives the young man a clear idea of
    demonstration and habituates him to form long trains of thought
    and reasoning methodically connected and sustained by the final
    certainty of the result; and it has the further advantage, from
    a purely moral point of view, of inspiring an absolute and
    fanatical respect for truth. In addition to all this,
    mathematics, and chiefly algebra and infinitesimal calculus,
    excite to a high degree the conception of the signs and
    symbols—necessary instruments to extend the
    power and reach of the human mind by summarizing an aggregate
    of relations in a condensed form and in a kind of mechanical
    way. These auxiliaries are of special value in mathematics
    because they are there adequate to their definitions, a
    characteristic which they do not possess to the same degree in
    the physical and mathematical [natural?] sciences.</p>

    I do not intend to go deeply into the question how
    far mathematical studies, as the representatives of conscious
    logical reasoning, should take a more important place in school
    education. But it is, in reality, one of the questions of the
    day. In proportion as the range of science extends, its system
    and organization must be improved, and it must inevitably come
    about that individual students will find themselves compelled
    to go through a stricter course of training than grammar is in
    a position to supply. What strikes me in my own experience with
    students who pass from our classical schools to scientific and
    medical studies, is first, a certain laxity in the application
    of strictly universal laws. The grammatical rules, in which
    they have been exercised, are for the most part followed by
    long lists of exceptions; accordingly they are not in the habit
    of relying implicitly on the certainty of a legitimate
    deduction from a strictly universal law. Secondly, I find them
    for the most part too much inclined to trust to authority, even
    in cases where they might form an independent judgment. In
    fact, in philological studies, inasmuch as it is seldom
    possible to take in the whole of the premises at a glance, and
    inasmuch as the decision of disputed questions often depends on
    an æsthetic feeling for beauty of expression, or
    for the genius of the language, attainable only by long
    training, it must often happen that the student is referred to
    authorities even by the best teachers. Both faults are
    traceable to certain indolence and vagueness of thought, the
    sad effects of which are not confined to subsequent scientific
    studies. But certainly the best remedy for both is to be found
    in mathematics, where there is absolute certainty in the
    reasoning, and no authority is recognized but that of one’s own
    intelligence.—<span class="smcap">Helmholtz, H.</span></p>

    What renders a problem definite, and what leaves it
    indefinite, may best be understood from mathematics. The very
    important idea of solving a problem within limits of error is
    an element of rational culture, coming from the same source.
    The art of totalizing fluctuations by curves is capable of
    being carried, in conception, far beyond the mathematical domain,

    mathematical contribution to Logic, and is of paramount
    importance.—<span class="smcap">Bain, Alexander.</span></p>

    We receive it as a fact, that some minds are so
    constituted as absolutely to require for their nurture the
    severe logic of the abstract sciences; that rigorous sequence
    of ideas which leads from the premises to the conclusion, by a
    path, arduous and narrow, it may be, and which the youthful
    reason may find it hard to mount, but where it cannot stray;
    and on which, if it move at all, it must move onward and
    upward.... Even for intellects of a different character, whose
    natural aptitude is for moral evidence and those relations of
    ideas which are perceived and appreciated by taste, the study
    of the exact sciences may be recommended as the best protection
    against the errors into which they are most likely to fall.
    Although the study of language is in many respects no mean
    exercise in logic, yet it must be admitted that an eminently

    The value of mathematical instruction as a

    in the applicability not of its doctrines but of its methods.
    Mathematics will ever remain the past perfect type of the
    deductive method in general; and the applications of
    mathematics to the simpler branches of physics furnish the only
    school in which philosophers can effectually learn the most
    difficult and important of their art, the employment of the
    laws of simpler phenomena for explaining and predicting those
    of the more complex. These grounds are quite sufficient for
    deeming mathematical training an indispensable basis of real

    This science, Geometry, is one of indispensable use

    nature; for the relations of space and number are the
    <em>alphabet</em> in which those laws are written. But besides
    the interest and importance of this kind which geometry
    possesses, it has a great and peculiar value for all who wish
    to understand the foundations of human knowledge, and the
    methods by which it is acquired. For the student of geometry
    acquires, with a degree of insight and clearness which the
    unmathematical reader can but feebly imagine, a conviction that
    there are necessary truths, many of them of a very complex and
    striking character; and that a few of the most simple and

    be expected to acquire the habit of trusting to its own

    Thinking is merely the comparing of ideas,
    discerning relations of likeness and of difference between
    ideas, and drawing inferences. It is seizing general truths on
    the basis of clearly apprehended particulars. It is but
    generalizing and particularizing. Who will deny that a child
    can deal profitably with sequences of ideas like: How many
    marbles are 2 marbles and 3 marbles? 2 pencils and 3 pencils? 2

    these ways for himself, that one can think and work
    independently, have a real, a positive, and a purifying effect
    upon moral character. They are the quiet, steady undertones of
    the work that always appeal to the learner for the sanction of
    his best judgment, and these are the really significant matters
    in school work. It is not the noise and bluster, not even the
    dramatics or the polemics from the teacher’s
    desk, that abide longest and leave the deepest and stablest
    imprint upon character. It is these still, small voices that
    speak unmistakably for the right and against the wrong and the
    erroneous that really form human character. When the school

    In mathematics two ends are constantly kept in
    view: First, stimulation of the inventive faculty, exercise of
    judgment, development of logical reasoning, and the habit of
    concise statement; second, the association of the branches of
    pure mathematics with each other and with applied science, that
    the pupil may see clearly the true relations of principles and
    things.</p>

    body of geometrical truths, the power to draw correct
    inferences from given premises, the power to use algebraic
    processes as a means of finding results in practical problems,
    and the awakening of interest in the science of mathematics.</p>

    In the secondary schools mathematics should be a
    part of general culture and not contributory to technical
    training of any kind; it should cultivate space intuition,
    logical thinking, the power to rephrase in clear language
    thoughts recognized as correct, and ethical and esthetic
    effects; so treated, mathematics is a quite indispensable
    factor of general education in so far as

    I am of the decided opinion, that mathematical
    instruction must have for its first aim a deep penetration and
    complete command of abstract mathematical theory together with
    a clear insight into the structure of the system, and doubt not
    that the instruction which accomplishes this is valuable and
    interesting even if it neglects practical applications. If the
    instruction sharpens the understanding, if it arouses the
    scientific interest, whether mathematical or philosophical, if
    finally it calls into life an esthetic feeling for the beauty
    of a scientific edifice, the instruction will take on an
    ethical value as well, provided that with the interest it
    awakens also the impulse toward scientific activity. I contend,
    therefore, that even without reference to its applications
    mathematics in the high schools has a value equal to that of
    the other subjects of
    instruction.—<span class="smcap">Goetting, E.</span></p>

    Mathematics will not be properly esteemed in wider

    schools, and until the unfortunate impression is gotten rid of
    that mathematics serves no other purpose in instruction than
    the <em>formal</em> training of the mind. The aim of mathematics
    is its <em>content</em>, its form is a secondary consideration
    and need not necessarily be that historic form which is due to
    the circumstance that mathematics took permanent shape under

    I believe that the useful methods of mathematics
    are easily to be learned by quite young persons, just as
    languages are easily learned in youth. What a wondrous
    philosophy and history underlie the use of almost every word in
    every language—yet the child learns to use
    the word unconsciously. No doubt when such a word was first
    invented it was studied over and lectured upon, just as one
    might lecture now upon the idea of a rate, or the use of
    Cartesian co-ordinates, and we may depend upon it that children
    of the future will use the idea of the calculus, and use
    squared paper as readily as they now cipher.... When Egyptian
    and Chaldean philosophers spent years in difficult
    calculations, which would now be thought easy by young
    children, doubtless they had the same notions of the depth of
    their knowledge that Sir William Thomson might now have of his.
    How is it, then, that Thomson gained his immense knowledge in
    the time taken by a Chaldean philosopher to acquire a simple
    knowledge of arithmetic? The reason is plain. Thomson, when a
    child, was taught in a few years more than all that was known
    three thousand years ago of the properties of numbers. When it
    is found essential to a boy’s future that
    machinery should be given to his brain, it is given to him; he
    is taught to use it, and his bright memory makes the use of it a

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_75"
      id="Page_75">75</a></span>

    second nature to him; but it is not
    till after-life that he makes a close investigation of what
    there actually is in his brain which has enabled him to do so
    much. It is taken because the child has much faith. In after
    years he will accept nothing without careful consideration. The
    machinery given to the brain of children is getting more and
    more complicated as time goes on; but there is really no reason
    why it should not be taken in as early, and used as readily, as
    were the axioms of childish education in ancient
    Chaldea.—<span class="smcap">Perry, John.</span></p>

    The ancients devoted a lifetime to the study of
    arithmetic; it required days to extract a square root or to
    multiply two numbers together. Is there any harm in skipping
    all that, in letting the school boy learn multiplication sums,
    and in starting his more abstract reasoning at a more advanced
    point? Where would be the harm in letting the boy assume the
    truth of many propositions of the first four books of Euclid,
    letting him assume their truth partly by faith, partly by
    trial? Giving him the whole fifth book of Euclid by simple
    algebra? Letting him assume the sixth as axiomatic? Letting
    him, in fact, begin his severer studies where he is now in the
    habit of leaving off? We do much less orthodox things. Every
    here and there in one’s mathematical studies
    one makes exceedingly large assumptions, because the methodical
    study would be ridiculous even in the eyes of the most pedantic
    of teachers. I can imagine a whole year devoted to the
    philosophical study of many things that a student now takes in
    his stride without trouble. The present method of training the
    mind of a mathematical teacher causes it to strain at gnats and
    to swallow camels. Such gnats are most of the propositions of
    the sixth book of Euclid; propositions generally about
    incommensurables; the use of arithmetic in geometry; the
    parallelogram of forces, etc.,
    decimals.—<span class="smcap">Perry, John.</span></p>

    not attending to general principles and teaching instead of
    particular rules.... I am inclined to attack the teaching of

    A superficial knowledge of mathematics may lead to
    the belief that this subject can be taught incidentally, and
    that exercises akin to counting the petals of flowers or the
    legs of a grasshopper are mathematical. Such work ignores the
    fundamental idea out of which quantitative reasoning
    grows—the equality of magnitudes. It leaves
    the pupil unaware of that relativity which is the essence of
    mathematical science. Numerical statements are frequently
    required in the study of natural history, but to repeat these
    as a drill upon numbers will scarcely lend charm to these

    First, as concerns the <em>success</em> of teaching
    mathematics. No instruction in the high schools is as difficult
    as that of mathematics, since the large majority of students
    are at first decidedly disinclined to be harnessed into the
    rigid framework of logical conclusions. The interest of young
    people is won much more easily, if sense-objects are made the
    starting point and the transition to abstract formulation is
    brought about gradually. For this reason it is psychologically
    quite correct to follow this course.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Not less to be recommended is this course if we inquire into
    the essential purpose of mathematical instruction. Formerly it
    was too exclusively held that this purpose is to sharpen the
    understanding. Surely another important end is to implant in
    the student the conviction that <em>correct thinking based on
    true premises secures mastery over the outer world</em>. To
    accomplish this the outer world must receive its share of
    attention from the very beginning.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Doubtless this is true but there is a danger which needs
    pointing out. It is as in the case of language teaching where
    the modern tendency is to secure in addition to grammar also an
    understanding of the authors. The danger lies in grammar being
    completely set aside leaving the subject without its
    indispensable solid basis. Just so in the teaching of
    mathematics it is possible to accumulate interesting
    applications to such an extent as to stunt the essential
    logical development. This should in no wise be permitted, for
    thus the kernel of the whole matter is lost. Therefore: We do
    want throughout a quickening of mathematical instruction by the
    introduction of applications, but we do not want that the
    pendulum, which in former decades may have inclined too much
    toward the abstract side, should now swing to the other
    extreme; we would rather pursue the proper middle
    course.—<span class="smcap">Klein, Felix.</span></p>

    It is above all the duty of the methodical
    text-book to adapt itself to the pupil’s
    power of comprehension, only challenging his higher efforts
    with the increasing development of his imagination, his logical
    power and the ability of abstraction. This indeed constitutes a
    test of the art of teaching, it is here where pedagogic tact
    becomes manifest. In reference to the axioms, caution is
    necessary. It should be pointed out comparatively early, in how
    far the mathematical body differs from the material body.
    Furthermore, since mathematical bodies are really portions of
    space, this space is to be conceived as mathematical space and
    to be clearly distinguished from real or physical space.
    Gradually the student will become conscious that the portion of
    the real space which lies beyond the visible stellar universe
    is not cognizable through the senses, that we know nothing of
    its properties and consequently have no basis for judgments
    concerning it. Mathematical space, on the other hand, may be
    subjected to conditions, for instance, we may condition its
    properties at infinity, and these conditions constitute the
    axioms, say the Euclidean axioms. But every student will
    require years before the conviction of the truth of this last
    statement will force itself upon
    him.—<span class="smcap">Holzmüller, Gustav.</span></p>

    [mathematics] furnishes; these may be graduated to precisely
    the amount of attainment which may be possessed, while yet
    retaining an interest and value. It seems to me that no other
    branch of study at all compares with mathematics in this. When
    we propose a deduction to a beginner we give him an exercise in
    many cases that would have been admired in the vigorous days of
    Greek geometry. Although grammatical exercises are well suited
    to insure the great benefits connected with the study of
    languages, yet these exercises seem to me stiff and artificial
    in comparison with the problems of mathematics. It is not
    absurd to maintain that Euclid and Apollonius would have

    Computations, are newly received into Geometry, and that
    unwarily, and contrary to the first Design of this Science. For
    whosoever considers the Construction of a Problem by a right
    Line and a Circle, found out by the first Geometricians, will
    easily perceive that Geometry was invented that we might
    expeditiously avoid, by drawing Lines, the Tediousness of
    Computation. Therefore these two Sciences ought not to be
    confounded. The Ancients did so industriously distinguish them
    from one another, that they never introduced Arithmetical Terms
    into Geometry. And the Moderns, by confounding both, have lost
    the Simplicity in which all the Elegance of Geometry consists.
    Wherefore that is <em>Arithmetically</em> more simple which is
    determined by the more simple Equation, but that is
    <em>Geometrically</em> more simple which is determined by the
    more simple drawing of Lines; and in Geometry,

    in so-called practical or illustrative problems, which are

    Few will deny that even in the first scientific
    instruction in mathematics the most rigorous method is to be
    given preference over all others. Especially will every teacher
    prefer a consistent proof to one which is based on fallacies or
    proceeds in a vicious circle, indeed it will be morally
    impossible for the teacher to present a proof of the latter
    kind consciously and thus in a sense deceive his pupils.
    Notwithstanding these objectionable so-called proofs, so far as
    the foundation and the development of the system is concerned,
    predominate in our textbooks to the present time. Perhaps it
    will be answered, that rigorous proof is found too difficult
    for the pupil’s power of comprehension. Should this be anywhere
    the case,—which would only indicate some defect in the plan or
    treatment of the whole,—the only remedy would be to merely
    state the theorem in a historic way, and forego a proof with
    the frank confession that no proof has been found which could
    be comprehended by the pupil; a remedy which is ever doubtful
    and should only be applied in the case of extreme necessity.
    But this remedy is to be preferred to a proof which is no
    proof, and is therefore either wholly unintelligible to the
    pupil, or deceives him with an appearance of knowledge which
    opens the door to all superficiality and lack of scientific
    method.—<span class="smcap">Grassmann, Hermann.</span></p>

    The average English author [of mathematical texts]
    leaves one under the impression that he has made a bargain with
    his reader to put before him the truth, the greater part of the
    truth, and nothing but the truth; and that if he has put the
    facts of his subject into his book, however difficult it may be
    to unearth them, he has fulfilled his contract with his reader.
    This is a very much mistaken view, because <em>effective
    teaching</em> requires a great deal more than a bare recitation
    of facts, even if these are duly set forth in logical
    order—as in English books they often are
    not. The probable difficulties which will occur to the student,
    the objections which the intelligent student will naturally and
    necessarily raise to some statement of fact or
    theory—these things our authors seldom or
    never notice, and yet a recognition and anticipation of them by
    the author would be often of priceless value to the student.
    Again, a touch of <em>humour</em> (strange as the contention may
    seem) in mathematical works is not only possible with perfect
    propriety, but very helpful; and I could give instances of this

    The first thing to be attended to in reading any

    the different processes there exhibited, and of their
    connection with one another. This cannot be attained by the
    mere reading of the book, however great the attention which may
    be given. It is impossible in a mathematical work to fill up
    every process in the manner in which it must be filled up in
    the mind of the student before he can be said to have
    completely mastered it. Many results must be given of which the
    details are suppressed, such are the additions,
    multiplications, extractions of square roots, etc., with which
    the investigations abound. These must not be taken on trust by
    the student, but must be worked out by his own pen, which must
    never be out of his own hand while engaged in any mathematical
    process.—<span class="smcap">De Morgan, A.</span></p>

    The student should read his author with the most
    sustained attention, in order to discover the meaning of every
    sentence. If the book is well written, it will endure and repay
    his close attention: the text ought to be fairly intelligible,
    even without illustrative examples. Often, far too often, a
    reader hurries over the text without any sincere and vigorous
    effort to understand it; and rushes to some example to clear up
    what ought not to have been obscure, if it had been adequately
    considered. The habit of scrupulously investigating the text
    seems to me important on several grounds. The close scrutiny of
    language is a very valuable exercise both for studious and
    practical life. In the higher departments of mathematics the
    habit is indispensable: in the long investigations which occur
    there it would be impossible to interpose illustrative examples
    at every stage, the student must therefore encounter and

    It is certainly true that all physical phenomena
    are subject to strictly mathematical conditions, and
    mathematical processes are unassailable in themselves. The
    trouble arises from the data employed. Most phenomena are so
    highly complex that one can never be quite sure that he is
    dealing with all the factors until the experiment proves it. So
    that experiment is rather the criterion of mathematical
    conclusions and must lead the

    The history of mathematics may be instructive as
    well as agreeable; it may not only remind us of what we have,
    but may also teach us to increase our store. Says De Morgan,
    “The early history of the mind of men with
    regards to mathematics leads us to point out our own errors;
    and in this respect it is well to pay attention to the history
    of mathematics.” It warns us against hasty
    conclusions; it points out the importance of a good notation
    upon the progress of the science; it discourages excessive
    specialization on the part of the investigator, by showing how
    apparently distinct branches have been found to possess
    unexpected connecting links; it saves the student from wasting
    time and energy upon problems which were, perhaps, solved long
    since; it discourages him from attacking an unsolved problem by
    the same method which has led other mathematicians to failure;
    it teaches that fortifications can be taken by other ways than
    by direct attack, that when repulsed from a direct assault it
    is well to reconnoitre and occupy the surrounding ground and to
    discover the secret paths by which the apparently unconquerable
    position can be taken.—<span class="smcap">Cajori, F.</span></p>

    It would seem at first sight as if the rapid
    expansion of the region of mathematics must be a source of
    danger to its future progress. Not only does the area widen but
    the subjects of study increase rapidly in number, and the work
    of the mathematician tends to become more and more specialized.
    It is, of course, merely a brilliant exaggeration to say that
    no mathematician is able to understand the work of any other
    mathematician, but it is certainly true that it is daily
    becoming more and more difficult for a mathematician to keep
    himself acquainted, even in a general way, with the progress of
    any of the branches of mathematics except those which form the
    field of his own labours. I believe, however, that the
    increasing extent of the territory of mathematics will always
    be counteracted by increased facilities in the means of
    communication. Additional knowledge opens to us new principles
    and methods which may conduct us with the greatest ease to
    results which previously were most difficult of access; and
    improvements in notation may exercise the most powerful effects
    both in the simplification and accessibility of a subject. It
    rests with the worker in mathematics not only to explore new
    truths, but to devise the language by which they may be
    discovered and expressed; and the genius of a great
    mathematician displays itself no less in the notation he
    invents for deciphering his subject than in the results
    attained.... I have great faith in the power of well-chosen
    notation to simplify complicated theories and to bring remote
    ones near and I think it is safe to predict that the increased
    knowledge of principles and the resulting improvements in the
    symbolic language of mathematics will always enable us to
    grapple satisfactorily with the difficulties arising from the
    mere extent of the subject.—<span class=

    Quite distinct from the theoretical question of the
    manner in which mathematics will rescue itself from the perils
    to which it is exposed by its own prolific nature is the
    practical problem of finding means of rendering available for
    the student the results which have been already accumulated,
    and making it possible for the learner to obtain some idea of
    the present state of the various departments of mathematics....
    The great mass of mathematical literature will be always
    contained in Journals and Transactions, but there is no reason
    why it should not be rendered far more useful and accessible
    than at present by means of treatises or higher text-books. The
    whole science suffers from want of avenues of approach, and
    many beautiful branches of mathematics are regarded as
    difficult and technical merely because they are not easily
    accessible.... I feel very strongly that any introduction to a
    new subject written by a competent person confers a real
    benefit on the whole science. The number of excellent
    text-books of an elementary kind that are published in this
    country makes it all the more to be regretted that we have so
    few that are intended for the advanced student. As an example
    of the higher kind of text-book, the want of which is so badly
    felt in many subjects, I may mention the second part of Prof.
    Chrystal’s “Algebra” published last year,
    which in a small compass gives a great mass of valuable and
    fundamental knowledge that has hitherto been beyond the reach
    of an ordinary student, though in reality lying so close at
    hand. I may add that in any treatise or higher text-book it is
    always desirable that references to the original memoirs should
    be given, and, if possible, short historic notices also. I am

    Mathematicians attach great importance to the
    elegance of their methods and their results. This is not pure
    dilettantism. What is it indeed that gives us the feeling of
    elegance in a solution, in a demonstration? It is the harmony
    of the diverse parts, their symmetry, their happy balance; in a
    word it is all that introduces order, all that gives unity,
    that permits us to see clearly and to comprehend at once both
    the <em>ensemble</em> and the details. But this is exactly what
    yields great results, in fact the more we see this aggregate
    clearly and at a single glance, the better we perceive its
    analogies with other neighboring objects,

    consequently the more chances we have of divining the possible
    generalizations. Elegance may produce the feeling of the
    unforeseen by the unexpected meeting of objects we are not
    accustomed to bring together; there again it is fruitful, since
    it thus unveils for us kinships before unrecognized. It is
    fruitful even when it results only from the contrast between
    the simplicity of the means and the complexity of the problem
    set; it makes us then think of the reason for this contrast and
    very often makes us see that chance is not the reason; that it
    is to be found in some unexpected law. In a word, the feeling
    of mathematical elegance is only the satisfaction due to any
    adaptation of the solution to the needs of our mind, and it is
    because of this very adaptation that this solution can be for
    us an instrument. Consequently this esthetic satisfaction is

    judged differently by different men, and changes with the times
    and circumstances. It has often happened that great importance
    has been attached to a problem merely on account of the
    difficulties which it presented; and indeed if for its solution
    it has been necessary to invent new methods, noteworthy
    artifices, etc., the science has gained more perhaps through
    these than through the final result. In general we may call
    important all investigations relating to things which in
    themselves are important; all those which have a large degree
    of generality, or which unite under a single point of view
    subjects apparently distinct, simplifying and elucidating them;
    all those which lead to results that promise to be the source
    of numerous consequences; etc.—<span class=

    The origin of a science is usually to be sought for
    not in any systematic treatise, but in the investigation and
    solution of some particular problem. This is especially the
    case in the ordinary history of the great improvements in any
    department of mathematical science. Some problem, mathematical
    or physical, is proposed, which is found to be insoluble by
    known methods. This condition of insolubility may arise from
    one of two causes: Either there exists no machinery powerful
    enough to effect the required reduction, or the workmen are not
    sufficiently expert to employ their tools in the performance of
    an entirely new piece of work. The problem proposed is,
    however, finally solved, and in its solution some new
    principle, or new application of old principles, is necessarily
    introduced. If a principle is brought to light it is soon found
    that in its application it is not necessarily limited to the
    particular question which occasioned its discovery, and it is
    then stated in an abstract form and applied to problems of
    gradually increasing generality.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Other principles, similar in their nature, are added, and the
    original principle itself receives such
    modifications and extensions

    as are from time to time
    deemed necessary. The same is true of new applications of old
    principles; the application is first thought to be merely
    confined to a particular problem, but it is soon recognized
    that this problem is but one, and generally a very simple one,
    out of a large class, to which the same process of
    investigation and solution are applicable. The result in both
    of these cases is the same. A time comes when these several
    problems, solutions, and principles are grouped together and
    found to produce an entirely new and consistent method; a
    nomenclature and uniform system of notation is adopted, and the
    principles of the new method become entitled to rank as a
    distinct science.—<span class="smcap">Craig, Thomas.</span></p>

    Today it is no longer questioned that the

    the synthesists lack two things in order to engage in a general

    definition of imaginary elements, on the other an
    interpretation of general algebraic concepts. Both of these
    have subsequently been developed in synthetic form, but to do
    this the essential principle of synthetic geometry had to be
    set aside. This principle which manifests itself so brilliantly
    in the theory of linear forms and the forms of the second

    If we view mathematical speculations with reference

    classes. To the first belong those which furnish some marked
    advantage either to common life or to some art, and the value
    of such is usually determined by the magnitude of this
    advantage. The other class embraces those speculations which,
    though offering no direct advantage, are nevertheless valuable
    in that they extend the boundaries of analysis and increase our
    resources and skill. Now since many investigations, from which
    great advantage may be expected, must be abandoned solely

    The Greeks in the first vigour of their pursuit of
    mathematical truth, at the time of Plato and soon after, had by
    no means confined themselves to those propositions which had a
    visible bearing on the phenomena of nature; but had followed
    out many beautiful trains of research concerning various kinds
    of figures, for the sake of their beauty alone; as for instance
    in their doctrine of Conic Sections, of which curves they had
    discovered all the principal properties. But it is curious to
    remark, that these investigations, thus pursued at first as
    mere matters of curiosity and intellectual gratification, were
    destined, two thousand years later, to play a very important

    A great department of thought must have its own
    inner life, however transcendent may be the importance of its
    relations to the outside. No department of science, least of
    all one requiring so high a degree of mental concentration as
    Mathematics, can be developed entirely, or even mainly, with a
    view to applications outside its own range. The increased
    complexity and specialisation of all branches of knowledge
    makes it true in the present, however it may have been in
    former times, that important advances in such a department as
    Mathematics can be expected only from men who are interested in
    the subject for its own sake, and who, whilst keeping an open
    mind for suggestions from outside, allow their thought to range
    freely in those lines of advance which are indicated by the
    present state of their subject, untrammelled by any
    preoccupation as to applications to other departments of
    science. Even with a view to applications, if Mathematics is to
    be adequately equipped for the purpose of coping with the
    intricate problems which will be presented to it in the future
    by Physics, Chemistry and other branches of physical science,
    many of these problems probably of a character which we cannot

    To emphasize this opinion that mathematicians would
    be unwise to accept practical issues as the sole guide or the
    chief guide in the current of their investigations, ... let me
    take one more instance, by choosing a subject in which the
    purely mathematical interest is deemed supreme, the theory of
    functions of a complex variable. That at least is a theory in
    pure mathematics, initiated in that region, and developed in
    that region; it is built up in scores of papers, and its plan
    certainly has not been, and is not now, dominated or guided by
    considerations of applicability to natural phenomena. Yet what
    has turned out to be its relation to practical issues? The
    investigations of Lagrange and others upon the construction of
    maps appear as a portion of the general property of conformal
    representation; which is merely the general geometrical method of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_107"

    regarding functional relations in
    that theory. Again, the interesting and important
    investigations upon discontinuous two-dimensional fluid motion
    in hydrodynamics, made in the last twenty years, can all be,
    and now are all, I believe, deduced from similar considerations
    by interpreting functional relations between complex variables.
    In the dynamics of a rotating heavy body, the only substantial
    extension of our knowledge since the time of Lagrange has
    accrued from associating the general properties of functions
    with the discussion of the equations of motion. Further, under
    the title of conjugate functions, the theory has been applied
    to various questions in electrostatics, particularly in
    connection with condensors and electrometers. And, lastly, in
    the domain of physical astronomy, some of the most conspicuous
    advances made in the last few years have been achieved by
    introducing into the discussion the ideas, the principles, the
    methods, and the results of the theory of functions ... the
    refined and extremely difficult work of Poincaré
    and others in physical astronomy has been possible only by the

    The golden age of
    mathematics—that was not the age of Euclid,
    it is ours. Ours is the age when no less than six international
    congresses have been held in the course of nine years. It is in
    our day that more than a dozen mathematical societies contain a
    growing membership of more than two thousand men representing
    the centers of scientific light throughout the great culture
    nations of the world. It is in our time that over five hundred
    scientific journals are each devoted in part, while more than
    two score others are devoted exclusively, to the publication of
    mathematics. It is in our time that the <i lang="de"
    xml:lang="de">Jahrbuch
    über die Fortschritte der Mathematik</i>, though
    admitting only condensed abstracts with titles, and not
    reporting on all the journals, has, nevertheless, grown to
    nearly forty huge volumes in as many years. It is in our time
    that as many as two thousand books and memoirs drop from the
    mathematical press of the world in a single year, the estimated
    number mounting up to fifty thousand in the last generation.
    Finally, to adduce yet another evidence of a similar kind, it
    requires not less than seven ponderous tomes of the forthcoming
    <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Encyclopaedie der Mathematischen
    Wissenschaften</i> to
    contain, not expositions, not demonstrations, but merely

    dominant feeling of the mathematician. Few people outside of
    the small circle of mathematical specialists have any idea of
    the vast growth of mathematical literature. The Royal Society

    on subjects of Pure Mathematics alone, which have appeared in
    seven hundred serials during the nineteenth century. This

    If a mathematician of the past, an Archimedes or
    even a Descartes, could view the field of geometry in its
    present condition, the first feature to impress him would be
    its lack of concreteness. There are whole classes of geometric
    theories which proceed not only without models and diagrams,
    but without the slightest (apparent) use of spatial intuition.
    In the main this is due, to the power of the analytic
    instruments of investigations as compared with the purely
    geometric.—<span class="smcap">Kasner, Edward</span>.</p>

    In Euclid each proposition stands by itself; its
    connection with others is never indicated; the leading ideas
    contained in its proof are not stated; general principles do
    not exist. In modern methods, on the other hand, the greatest
    importance is attached to the leading thoughts which pervade
    the whole; and general principles, which bring whole groups of
    theorems under one aspect, are given rather than separate
    propositions. The whole tendency is toward generalization. A
    straight line is considered as given in its entirety, extending
    both ways to infinity, while Euclid is very careful never to
    admit anything but finite quantities. The treatment of the
    infinite is in fact another

<span class="pagenum">

    fundamental difference between the two methods. Euclid avoids
    it, in modern mathematics it is systematically introduced, for
    only thus is generality
    obtained.—<span class= "smcap">Cayley, Arthur</span>.</p>

    This is one of the greatest advantages of modern
    geometry over the ancient, to be able, through the
    consideration of positive and negative quantities, to include
    in a single enunciation the several cases which the same
    theorem may present by a change in the relative position of the
    different parts of a figure. Thus in our day the nine principal
    problems and the numerous particular cases, which form the
    object of eighty-three theorems in the two books <cite>De
    sectione determinata</cite> of Appolonius constitute only
    one problem which is resolved by a single
    equation.—<span class="smcap">Chasles, M.</span></p>

    <b><a name="Block_713" id="Block_713">713</a>.</b>
    Euclid always contemplates a straight line as drawn
    between two definite points, and is very careful to mention
    when it is to be produced beyond this segment. He never thinks
    of the line as an entity given once for all as a whole. This
    careful definition and limitation, so as to exclude an infinity
    not immediately apparent to the senses, was very characteristic
    of the Greeks in all their many activities. It is enshrined in
    the difference between Greek architecture and Gothic
    architecture, and between Greek religion and modern religion.
    The spire of a Gothic cathedral and the importance of the
    unbounded straight line in modern Geometry are both emblematic
    of the transformation of the modern
    world.—<span class="smcap">Whitehead, A. N.</span></p>

    <b><a name="Block_714" id="Block_714">714</a>.</b>
    The geometrical problems and theorems of the Greeks always
    refer to definite, oftentimes to rather complicated figures.
    Now frequently the points and lines of such a figure may assume
    very many different relative positions; each of these possible
    cases is then considered separately. On the contrary, present
    day mathematicians generate their figures one from another,
    and are accustomed to consider them subject to variation;

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_112"
      id="Page_112">112</a></span>

    in this manner they unite
    the various cases and combine them as much as possible by
    employing negative and imaginary magnitudes. For example, the
    problems which Appolonius treats in his two books <cite>De
    sectione rationis</cite>, are solved today by means of a single,
    universally applicable construction; Apollonius, on the
    contrary, separates it into more than eighty different cases
    varying only in position. Thus, as Hermann Hankel has fittingly
    remarked, the ancient geometry sacrifices to a seeming
    simplicity the true simplicity which consists in the unity of
    principles; it attained a trivial sensual presentability at the
    cost of the recognition of the relations of geometric forms in
    all their changes and in all the variations of their sensually
    presentable
    positions.—<span class="smcap">Reye, Theodore.</span></p>

    It is known that the mathematics prescribed for the
    high school [Gymnasien] is essentially Euclidean, while it is
    modern mathematics, the theory of functions and the
    infinitesimal calculus, which has secured for us an insight
    into the mechanism and laws of nature. Euclidean mathematics is
    indeed, a prerequisite for the theory of functions, but just as
    one, though he has learned the inflections of Latin nouns and
    verbs, will not thereby be enabled to read a Latin author much
    less to appreciate the beauties of a Horace, so Euclidean
    mathematics, that is the mathematics of the high school, is
    unable to unlock nature and her laws. Euclidean mathematics
    assumes the completeness and invariability of mathematical
    forms; these forms it describes with appropriate accuracy and
    enumerates their inherent and related properties with perfect
    clearness, order, and completeness, that is, Euclidean
    mathematics operates on forms after the manner that anatomy
    operates on the dead body and its members.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    On the other hand, the mathematics of variable
    magnitudes—function theory or
    analysis—considers mathematical forms in
    their genesis. By writing the equation of the parabola, we
    express its law of generation, the law according to which the
    variable point moves. The path, produced before the eyes of the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_113"
      id="Page_113">113</a></span>

    student by a point moving in accordance to this law, is
    the parabola.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    If, then, Euclidean mathematics treats space and number forms
    after the manner in which anatomy treats the dead body, modern
    mathematics deals, as it were, with the living body, with
    growing and changing forms, and thus furnishes an insight, not
    only into nature as she is and appears, but also into nature as
    she generates and creates,—reveals her transition steps and in
    so doing creates a mind for and understanding of the laws of
    becoming. Thus modern mathematics
    bears the same relation to Euclidean mathematics that
    physiology or biology ... bears to anatomy. But it is exactly
    in this respect that our view of nature is so far above that of
    the ancients; that we no longer look on nature as a quiescent
    complete whole, which compels admiration by its sublimity and
    wealth of forms, but that we conceive of her as a vigorous
    growing organism, unfolding according to definite, as delicate
    as far-reaching, laws; that we are able to lay hold of the
    permanent amidst the transitory, of law amidst fleeting
    phenomena, and to be able to give these their simplest and
    truest expression through the mathematical
    formulas.—<span class="smcap">Dillmann, E.</span></p>

    If we compare a mathematical problem with an

    attempts to demolish the rock gradually from the outside by
    means of hammer and chisel; but the modern mathematician

    All the modern higher mathematics is based on a

    from the first, was so in reality; but the evolvers of the
    modern higher calculus have known that it is so. Therefore
    elementary teachers who, at the present day, persist in
    thinking about algebra and arithmetic as dealing with laws of
    number, and about geometry as dealing with laws of surface and
    solid content, are doing the best that in them lies to put
    their pupils on the wrong track for reaching in the future any
    true understanding of the higher algebras. Algebras deal not
    with laws of number, but with such laws of the human thinking
    machinery as have been discovered in the course of
    investigations on numbers. Plane geometry deals with such laws
    of thought as were discovered by men intent on finding out how
    to measure surface; and solid geometry with such additional
    laws of thought as were discovered

    It is not only a decided preference for synthesis
    and a complete denial of general methods which characterizes
    the ancient mathematics as against our newer science [modern
    mathematics]: besides this external formal difference there is
    another real, more deeply seated, contrast, which arises from
    the different attitudes which the two assumed relative to the
    use of the concept of <em>variability</em>. For while the
    ancients, on account of considerations which had been
    transmitted to them from the philosophic school of the
    Eleatics, never employed the concept of motion, the spatial
    expression for variability, in their rigorous system, and made
    incidental use of it only in the treatment of phonoromically
    generated curves, modern geometry dates from the instant that
    Descartes left the purely algebraic treatment of equations and
    proceeded to investigate the variations which an algebraic

    Generality of points of view and of methods,
    precision and elegance in presentation, have become, since
    Lagrange, the common property of all who would lay claim to the
    rank of scientific mathematicians. And, even if this generality
    leads at times to abstruseness at the expense of intuition and
    applicability, so that general theorems are formulated which
    fail to apply to a single special case, if furthermore
    precision at times degenerates into a studied brevity which
    makes it more difficult to read an article than it was to write
    it; if, finally, elegance of form has well-nigh become in our
    day the criterion of the worth or worthlessness of a
    proposition,—yet are these conditions of the
    highest importance to a wholesome development, in that they
    keep the scientific material within the limits which are
    necessary both intrinsically and extrinsically if mathematics

    The majority of mathematical truths now possessed
    by us presuppose the intellectual toil of many centuries. A
    mathematician, therefore, who wishes today to acquire a
    thorough understanding of modern research in this department,
    must think over again in quickened tempo the mathematical
    labors of several centuries. This constant dependence of new
    truths on old ones stamps mathematics as a science of uncommon
    exclusiveness and renders it generally impossible to lay open
    to uninitiated readers a speedy path to the apprehension of the
    higher mathematical truths. For this reason, too, the theories
    and results of mathematics are rarely adapted for popular
    presentation.... This same inaccessibility of mathematics,
    although it secures for it a lofty and aristocratic place among
    the sciences, also renders it odious to those who have never
    learned it, and who dread the great labor involved in acquiring
    an understanding of the questions of modern mathematics.
    Neither in the languages nor in the natural sciences are the
    investigations and results so closely interdependent as to make
    it impossible to acquaint the uninitiated student with single

    It has long been a complaint against mathematicians
    that they are hard to convince: but it is a far greater
    disqualification both for philosophy, and for the affairs of
    life, to be too easily convinced; to have too low a standard of
    proof. The only sound intellects are those which, in the first
    instance, set their standards of proof high. Practice in
    concrete affairs soon teaches them to make the necessary
    abatement: but they retain the consciousness, without which
    there is no sound practical reasoning, that in accepting
    inferior evidence because there is no better to be had, they do

    men like Klein who survey the kingdoms of geometry and analysis
    for the endless variety of things that nourish there, as the
    eye of Darwin ranged over the flora and fauna of the world, or
    as a commercial monarch contemplates its industry, or as a
    statesman beholds an empire; when we reflect not only that the

    the master mathematician is constantly required to exercise
    judgment—judgment, that is, in matters not  of
    certainty—balancing probabilities not yet reduced nor even
    reducible perhaps to calculation; when we reflect that he is
    called upon to exercise a function analogous to that of the
    comparative anatomist like Cuvier, comparing theories and
    doctrines of every degree of similarity and dissimilarity of
    structure; when, finally, we reflect that he seldom deals with
    a single idea at a time, but is for the most part engaged
    in wielding organized hosts of them, as a general wields at
    once the division of an army or as
    a great civil administrator directs from his central office
    diverse and scattered but related groups of interests and

    We pass with admiration along the great series of
    mathematicians, by whom the science of theoretical mechanics
    has been cultivated, from the time of Newton to our own. There
    is no group of men of science whose fame is higher or brighter.
    The great discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, had fixed
    all eyes on those portions of human knowledge on which their
    successors employed their labors. The certainty belonging to
    this line of speculation seemed to elevate mathematicians above
    the students of other subjects; and the beauty of mathematical
    relations and the subtlety of intellect which may be shown in
    dealing with them, were fitted to win unbounded applause. The
    successors of Newton and the Bernoullis, as Euler, Clairaut,

    Two extreme views have always been held as to the
    use of mathematics. To some, mathematics is only measuring and
    calculating instruments, and their interest ceases as soon as
    discussions arise which cannot benefit those who use the
    instruments for the purposes of application in mechanics,
    astronomy, physics, statistics, and other sciences. At the
    other extreme we have those who are animated exclusively by the
    love of pure science. To them pure mathematics, with the theory
    of numbers at the head, is the only real and genuine science,
    and the applications have only an interest in so far as they
    contain or suggest problems in pure mathematics.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Of the two greatest mathematicians of modern times, Newton and
    Gauss, the former can be considered as a representative of the
    first, the latter of the second class; neither of them was
    exclusively so, and Newton’s inventions in
    the science of pure mathematics were probably equal to
    Gauss’s work in applied mathematics.
    Newton’s reluctance to publish the method of
    fluxions invented and used by him may perhaps be attributed to
    the fact that he was not satisfied with the logical foundations
    of the Calculus; and Gauss is known to have abandoned his
    electro-dynamic speculations, as he could not find a satisfying
    physical basis....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Newton’s greatest work, the “Principia”, laid the foundation
    of mathematical physics; Gauss’s greatest work, the
    “Disquisitiones Arithmeticae”, that of higher arithmetic as
    distinguished from algebra. Both works, written in the
    synthetic style of the ancients, are difficult, if not
    deterrent, in their form, neither of them leading the reader
    by easy steps to the results. It took twenty or more years
    before either of these works received due recognition; neither
    found favour at once before that great tribunal of mathematical
    thought, the Paris Academy of Sciences....</p>

    I know, indeed, and can conceive of no pursuit so
    antagonistic to the cultivation of the oratorical faculty ...
    as the study of Mathematics. An eloquent mathematician must,
    from the nature of things, ever remain as rare a phenomenon as
    a talking fish, and it is certain that the more anyone gives
    himself up to the study of oratorical effect the less will he
    find himself in a fit state to mathematicize. It is the
    constant aim of the mathematician to reduce all his expressions
    to their lowest terms, to retrench every superfluous word and
    phrase, and to condense the Maximum of meaning into the Minimum
    of language. He has to turn his eye ever inwards, to see
    everything in its dryest light, to train and inure himself to a
    habit of internal and impersonal reflection and elaboration of
    abstract thought, which makes it most difficult for him to
    touch or enlarge upon any of those themes which appeal to the
    emotional nature of his fellow-men. When called upon to speak
    in public he feels as a man might do who has passed all his
    life in peering through a microscope, and is suddenly called
    upon to take charge of a astronomical observatory. He has to
    get out of himself, as it were, and change the habitual focus

    Alexander the king of the Macedonians, began like a
    wretch to learn geometry, that he might know how little the
    earth was, whereof he had possessed very little. Thus, I say,
    like a wretch for this, because he was to understand that he
    did bear a false surname. For who can be great in so small a
    thing? Those things that were delivered were subtile, and to be
    learned by diligent attention: not which that mad man could
    perceive, who sent his thoughts beyond the ocean sea. Teach me,
    saith he, easy things. To whom his master said: These things be
    the same, and alike difficult unto all. Think thou that the
    nature of things saith this. These things whereof thou
    complainest, they are the same unto all: more easy things can
    be given unto none; but whosoever will, shall make those things
    more easy unto himself. How? With uprightness of

    Archimedes ... had stated that given the force, any
    given weight might be moved, and even boasted, we are told,
    relying on the strength of demonstration, that if there were
    another earth, by going into it he could remove this. Hiero
    being struck with amazement at this, and entreating him to make
    good this problem by actual experiment, and show some great
    weight moved by a small engine, he fixed accordingly upon a
    ship of burden out of the king’s arsenal,
    which could not be drawn out of the dock without great labor
    and many men; and,

    loading her with many passengers and
    a full freight, sitting himself the while far off with no great
    endeavor, but only holding the head of the pulley in his hand
    and drawing the cords by degrees, he drew the ship in a
    straight line, as smoothly and evenly, as if she had been in
    the sea. The king, astonished at this, and convinced of the
    power of the art, prevailed upon Archimedes to make him engines
    accommodated to all the purposes, offensive and defensive, of a
    siege ... the apparatus was, in most opportune time, ready at

    These machines [used in the defense of the
    Syracusans against the Romans under Marcellus] he [Archimedes]
    had designed and contrived, not as matters of any importance,
    but as mere amusements in geometry; in compliance with king
    Hiero’s desire and request, some time
    before, that he should reduce to practice some part of his
    admirable speculation in science, and by accommodating the
    theoretic truth to sensation and ordinary use, bring it more
    within the appreciation of people in general. Eudoxus and
    Archytas had been the first originators of this far-famed and
    highly-prized art of mechanics, which they employed as an
    elegant illustration of geometrical truths, and as means of
    sustaining experimentally, to the satisfaction of the senses
    conclusions too intricate for proof by words and diagrams. As,
    for example, to solve the problem, so often required in
    constructing geometrical figures, given the two extremes, to
    find the two mean lines of a proportion, both these
    mathematicians had recourse to the aid of instruments, adapting
    to their purpose certain curves and sections of lines. But what
    with Plato’s indignation at it, and his
    invectives against it as the mere corruption and annihilation
    of the one good of geometry,—which was thus
    shamefully turning its back upon the unembodied objects of pure
    intelligence to recur to sensation, and to ask help (not to be
    obtained without base supervisions and depravation) from
    matter; so it was that mechanics came to be separated from
    geometry, and, repudiated and neglected by philosophers, took
    its place as a military

    One feature which will probably most impress the
    mathematician accustomed to the rapidity and directness secured
    by the generality of modern methods is the <em>deliberation</em>
    with which Archimedes approaches the solution of any one of his
    main problems. Yet this very characteristic, with its
    incidental effects, is calculated to excite the more admiration
    because the method suggests the tactics of some great
    strategist who foresees everything, eliminates everything not
    immediately conducive to the execution of his plan, masters
    every position in its order, and then suddenly (when the very
    elaboration of the scheme has almost obscured, in the mind of
    the spectator, its ultimate object) strikes the final blow.
    Thus we read in Archimedes proposition after proposition the
    bearing of which is not immediately obvious but which we find
    infallibly used later on; and we are led by such easy stages
    that the difficulties of the original problem, as presented at
    the outset, are scarcely appreciated. As Plutarch says:
    “It is not possible to find in geometry more
    difficult and troublesome questions, or more simple and lucid
    explanations.” But it is decidedly a rhetorical
    exaggeration when Plutarch goes on to say that we are deceived
    by the easiness of the successive steps into the belief that
    anyone could have discovered them for himself. On the contrary,
    the studied simplicity and the perfect finish of the treatises
    involve at the same time an element of mystery. Though each
    step depends on the preceding ones, we are left in the dark as
    to how they were suggested to Archimedes. There is, in fact,
    much truth in a remark by Wallis to the effect that he seems
    “as it were of set purpose to have covered
    up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged
    posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished
    to extort from them assent to his results.” Wallis
    adds with equal reason that not only Archimedes but nearly all
    the ancients so hid away from posterity their method of
    Analysis (though it is certain that they had one) that more

    The opinion of Bacon on this subject [geometry] was
    diametrically opposed to that of the ancient philosophers. He
    valued geometry chiefly, if not solely, on account of those
    uses, which to Plato appeared so base. And it is remarkable
    that the longer Bacon lived the stronger this feeling became.
    When in 1605 he wrote the two books on the Advancement of
    Learning, he dwelt on the advantages which mankind derived from
    mixed mathematics; but he at the same time admitted that the
    beneficial effect produced by mathematical study on the
    intellect, though a collateral advantage, was
    “no less worthy than that which was
    principal and intended.” But it is evident that his
    views underwent a change. When near twenty years later, he
    published the <cite>De Augmentis</cite>, which is the Treatise on the
    Advancement of Learning, greatly expanded and carefully
    corrected, he made important alterations in the part which
    related to mathematics. He condemned with severity the
    pretensions of the mathematicians, “<i lang="la"
    xml:lang="la">delicias et fastum
    mathematicorum</i>.” Assuming the well-being of the
    human race to be the end of knowledge, he pronounced that
    mathematical science could claim no higher rank than that of an
    appendage or an auxiliary to other sciences. Mathematical
    science, he says, is the handmaid of natural philosophy; she
    ought to demean herself as such; and he declares that he cannot
    conceive by what ill chance it has happened that she presumes
    to claim precedence over her
    mistress.—<span class= "smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>

    He saw the importance of determining accurately the specific

    appreciate either the problem to be solved or the principles
    upon which the solution depended. In reviewing the progress of
    Mechanics, he makes no mention either of Archimedes, or
    Stevinus, Galileo, Guldinus, or Ghetaldus. He makes no allusion

    pound weight will fall nearly as fast through the air as a ball
    of two, without alluding to the theory of acceleration of
    falling bodies, which had been made known by Galileo more than
    thirty years before. He proposed an inquiry with regard to the

    arms of different length but equal weight the distance from the
    fulcrum has any effect upon the
    inclination—though the theory of the lever

    In the year 1692, James Bernoulli, discussing the logarithmic
    spiral [or equiangular spiral, ρ = α<sup>θ</sup>] ... shows
    that it reproduces itself in its evolute, its involute, and its
    caustics of both reflection and refraction, and then adds: "But
    since this marvellous spiral, by such a singular and wonderful
    peculiarity, pleases me so much that I can scarce be satisfied
    with thinking about it, I have thought that it might not be
    inelegantly used for a symbolic representation of various
    matters. For since it always produces a spiral similar to
    itself, indeed precisely the same spiral, however it may be
    involved or evolved, or reflected or refracted, it may be taken
    as an emblem of a progeny always in all things like the parent,

    if it is not forbidden to
    compare a theorem of eternal truth to the mysteries of our

    of the Son, who as an image of the Father, emanating from him,
    as light from light, remains ὁμοούσιος
    with him, howsoever overshadowed. Or, if you prefer, since our

    used as a symbol, either of fortitude and constancy in
    adversity, or, of the human body, which after all its changes,
    even after death, will be restored to its exact and perfect

    he generalizes and then subjects to computative tests, in the
    way the newly acquired data are made to yield at a single

    Cayley was singularly learned in the work of other

    read a memoir completely through: his custom was to read only
    so much as would enable him to grasp the meaning of the symbols
    and understand its scope. The main result would then become to
    him a subject of investigation: he would establish it (or test
    it) by algebraic analysis and, not infrequently, develop it so
    to obtain other results. This faculty of grasping and testing
    rapidly the work of others, together with his great knowledge,
    made him an invaluable referee; his services in this capacity

    J. J. Sylvester was an enthusiastic supporter of

    attitude on this question between the two foremost British
    mathematicians, J. J. Sylvester, the algebraist, and Arthur
    Cayley, the algebraist and geometer, was grotesque. Sylvester
    wished to bury Euclid “deeper than e’er plummet sounded” out
    of the schoolboy’s reach; Cayley, an ardent admirer
    of Euclid, desired the retention of Simson’s
    <em>Euclid</em>. When reminded that this treatise was a mixture
    of Euclid and Simson, Cayley suggested striking out

    any use.” And he dismissed the subject with a
    smile.—<span class="smcap">Thompson, S. P.</span></p>

    As he [Clifford] spoke he appeared not to be

    conditions on which the solution depended, and they seemed to
    stand out visibly in space. There were no longer consequences
    to be deduced, but real and evident facts which only required
    to be seen.... So whole and complete was his vision that for
    the time the only strange thing was that anybody should fail to
    see it in the same way. When one endeavored to call it up
    again, and not till then, it became clear that the magic of
    genius had been at work, and that the common sight had been

    his public lectures with no visible preparation beyond very
    short notes, and the outline seemed to be filled in without
    effort or hesitation. Afterwards he would revise the lecture
    from a shorthand writer’s report, or
    sometimes write down from memory almost exactly what he had
    said. It fell out now and then, however, that neither of these
    things was done; in such cases there is now no record of the

    I cannot find anything showing early aptitude for
    acquiring languages; but that he [Clifford] had it and was fond
    of exercising it in later life is certain. One practical reason
    for it was the desire of being able to read mathematical papers
    in foreign journals; but this would not account for his taking
    up Spanish, of which he acquired a competent knowledge in the
    course of a tour to the Pyrenees. When he was at Algiers in
    1876 he began Arabic, and made progress enough to follow in a
    general way a course of lessons given in that language. He read
    modern Greek fluently, and at one time he was furious about
    Sanskrit. He even spent some time on hieroglyphics. A new
    language is a riddle before it is conquered, a power in the
    hand afterwards: to Clifford every riddle was a challenge, and
    every chance of new power a divine opportunity to be seized.
    Hence he was likewise interested in the various modes of
    conveying and expressing language invented for special
    purposes, such as the Morse alphabet and shorthand.... I have
    forgotten to mention his command of French and German, the
    former of which he knew very well, and the latter quite
    sufficiently;....—<span class="smcap">Pollock, F.</span></p>

    one of the greatest feats of strength. His nerve at dangerous
    heights was extraordinary. I am appalled now to think that he
    climbed up and sat on the cross bars of the weathercock on a

    up and hung by my toes to the bars he did the same.</p>

    make the nearest integer a new age, do the same with that, and

    The general knowledge of our author [Leonhard

    who had pursued, with such unremitting ardor, mathematics and
    astronomy as his favorite studies. He had made a very
    considerable progress in medical, botanical, and chemical
    science. What was still more extraordinary, he was an excellent
    scholar, and possessed in a high degree what is generally
    called erudition. He had attentively read the most eminent
    writers of ancient Rome; the civil and literary history of all
    ages and all nations was familiar to him; and foreigners, who
    were only acquainted with his works, were astonished to find in
    the conversation of a man, whose long life seemed solely
    occupied in mathematical and physical researches and
    discoveries, such an extensive acquaintance with the most
    interesting branches of literature. In this respect, no doubt,

    might be desirable to check these expositions of doctrine. The
    Empress did not like to put a direct muzzle on her
    guest’s tongue, so the following plot was

    was in possession of an algebraical demonstration of the
    existence of God, and would give it him before all the Court,
    if he desired to hear it. Diderot gladly consented: though the
    name of the mathematician is not given, it was Euler. He
    advanced toward Diderot, and said gravely, and in a tone of

    in the circle of his

    even an accurate view of the processes of the human mind in the

    direct verification, it has succeeded in ascertaining the
    greatest number of important and recondite truths. This

    Endowed with two qualities, which seemed
    incompatible with each other, a volcanic imagination and a
    pertinacity of intellect which the most tedious numerical
    calculations could not daunt, Kepler conjectured that the
    movements of the celestial bodies must be connected together by
    simple laws, or, to use his own expression, by harmonic laws.
    These laws he undertook to discover. A thousand fruitless
    attempts, errors of calculation inseparable from a colossal
    undertaking, did not prevent him a single instant from
    advancing resolutely toward the goal of which he imagined he
    had obtained a glimpse. Twenty-two years were employed by him
    in this investigation, and still he was not weary of it! What,
    in reality, are twenty-two years of labor to him who is about
    to become the legislator of worlds; who shall inscribe his name
    in ineffaceable characters upon the frontispiece of an immortal

    to note the marked contrast in their
    styles. Lagrange is perfect both in form and matter, he is
    careful to explain his procedure, and though his arguments are
    general they are easy to follow. Laplace on the other hand
    explains nothing, is indifferent to style, and, if satisfied
    that his results are correct, is content to leave them either
    with no proof or with a faulty one. Gauss is as exact and
    elegant as Lagrange, but even more difficult to follow than
    Laplace, for he removes every trace of the analysis by which he
    reached his results, and studies to give a proof which while
    rigorous shall be as concise and synthetical as
    possible.—<span class="smcap">Ball, W. W. R.</span></p>

    Leibnitz’s discoveries lay in
    the direction in which all modern progress in science lies, in
    establishing order, symmetry, and harmony, i.e.,
    comprehensiveness and perspicuity,—rather
    than in dealing with single problems, in the solution of which
    followers soon attained greater dexterity than
    himself.—<span class="smcap">Merz, J. T.</span></p>

  <p class="v2">
    <b><a name="Block_990" id="Block_990">990</a>.</b>
    It was his [Leibnitz’s] love of
    method and order, and the conviction that such order and
    harmony existed in the real world, and that our success in
    understanding it depended upon the degree and order which we
    could attain in our own thoughts, that originally was probably
    nothing more than a habit which by degrees grew into a formal
    rule.<a
        href="#Footnote_8"
        title="This sentence has been reworded for the
purpose of this quotation."
        class="fnanchor">8</a>
    This habit was acquired
    by early occupation with legal and mathematical questions. We
    have seen how the theory of combinations and arrangements of
    elements had a special interest for him. We also saw how
    mathematical calculations served him as a type and model of
    clear and orderly reasoning, and how he tried to introduce
    method and system into logical discussions, by reducing to a
    small number of terms the multitude of compound notions he had
    to deal with. This tendency increased in strength, and even in
    those early years he elaborated the idea of a general
    arithmetic, with a universal language of symbols, or a
    characteristic which would be applicable to all reasoning
    processes, and reduce philosophical investigations to that
    simplicity and certainty which the use of algebraic symbols had
    introduced into mathematics.</p>

  <p class="v1">
    A mental attitude such as this is always highly favorable for
    mathematical as well as for philosophical investigations.
    Wherever

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_163"
      id="Page_163">163</a></span>

    progress depends upon
    precision and clearness of thought, and wherever such can be
    gained by reducing a variety of investigations to a general
    method, by bringing a multitude of notions under a common term
    or symbol, it proves inestimable. It necessarily imports the
    special qualities of number—viz., their continuity, infinity
    and infinite divisibility—like mathematical
    quantities—and destroys the notion that
    irreconcilable contrasts exist in nature, or gaps which cannot
    be bridged over. Thus, in his letter to Arnaud, Leibnitz
    expresses it as his opinion that geometry, or the philosophy of
    space, forms a step to the philosophy of
    motion—i.e., of corporeal things—and the philosophy of motion
    a step to the philosophy of mind.—<span class=

    Leibnitz believed he saw the image of creation in
    his binary arithmetic in which he employed only two characters,
    unity and zero. Since God may be represented by unity, and
    nothing by zero, he imagined that the Supreme Being might have
    drawn all things from nothing, just as in the binary arithmetic
    all numbers are expressed by unity with zero. This idea was so
    pleasing to Leibnitz, that he communicated it to the Jesuit
    Grimaldi, President of the Mathematical Board of China, with
    the hope that this emblem of the creation might convert to
    Christianity the reigning emperor who was particularly attached
    to the sciences.—<span class= "smcap">Laplace.</span></p>

    him in collaboration with Dr. Engel, but to his earlier
    memoirs, written during the first years of his scientific
    career. There Lie shows himself the true geometer that he is,
    while in his later publications, finding that he was but
    imperfectly understood by the mathematicians accustomed to the
    analytic point of view, he adopted a very general analytic form
    of treatment that is not always easy to

    It is said that the composing of the Lilawati was
    occasioned by the following circumstance. Lilawati was the name
    of the author’s [Bhascara] daughter,
    concerning whom it appeared, from the qualities of the
    ascendant at her birth, that she was destined to pass her life
    unmarried, and to remain without children. The father
    ascertained a lucky hour for contracting her in marriage, that
    she might be firmly connected and have children. It is said
    that when that hour approached, he brought his daughter and his
    intended son near him. He left the hour cup on the vessel of
    water and kept in attendance a time-knowing astrologer, in
    order that when the cup should subside in the water, those two
    precious jewels should be united. But, as the intended
    arrangement was not according to destiny, it happened that the
    girl, from a curiosity natural to children, looked into the
    cup, to observe the water coming in at the hole, when by chance
    a pearl separated from her bridal dress, fell into the cup,
    and, rolling down to the hole, stopped the influx of water. So
    the astrologer waited in expectation of the promised hour. When
    the operation of the cup had thus been delayed beyond all
    moderate time, the father was in consternation, and examining,
    he found that a small pearl had stopped the course of the
    water, and that the long-expected hour was passed. In short,
    the father, thus disappointed, said to his unfortunate
    daughter, I will write a book of your name, which shall remain
    to the latest times—for a good name is a
    second life, and the ground-work of eternal
    existence.—<span class="smcap">Fizi.</span></p>

    On the day of Cromwell’s death,
    when Newton was sixteen, a great storm raged all over England.
    He used to say, in his old age, that on that day he made his
    first purely scientific experiment. To ascertain the force of
    the wind, he first jumped with the wind and then against it;
    and, by comparing these distances with the extent of his own
    jump on a calm day, he was enabled to compute the force of the
    storm. When the wind blew thereafter, he used to say it was so
    many feet strong.—<span class="smcap">Parton, James.</span></p>

    On one occasion, when he was giving a dinner to
    some friends at the university, he left the table to get them a
    bottle of wine; but, on his way to the cellar, he fell into
    reflection, forgot his errand and his company, went to his
    chamber, put on his surplice, and proceeded to the chapel.
    Sometimes he would go into the street half dressed, and on
    discovering his condition, run back in great haste, much
    abashed. Often, while strolling in his garden, he would
    suddenly stop, and then run rapidly to his room, and begin to
    write, standing, on the first piece of paper that presented
    itself. Intending to dine in the public hall, he would go out
    in a brown study, take the wrong turn, walk a while, and then
    return to his room, having totally forgotten the dinner. Once
    having dismounted from his horse to lead him

    up a
    hill, the horse slipped his head out of the bridle; but Newton,
    oblivious, never discovered it till, on reaching a tollgate at
    the top of the hill, he turned to remount and perceived that
    the bridle which he held in his hand had no horse attached to
    it. His secretary records that his forgetfulness of his dinner
    was an excellent thing for his old housekeeper, who
    “sometimes found both dinner and supper
    scarcely tasted of, which the old woman has very pleasantly and
    mumpingly gone away with.” On getting out of bed in
    the morning, he has been discovered to sit on his bedside for
    hours without dressing himself, utterly absorbed in
    thought.—<span class="smcap">Parton, James.</span></p>

    of such habits as ... perseverance and vigilance. When he was
    asked how he made his discoveries, he answered,

    it was due to nothing but industry and patient thought:

    Professor Sylvester’s first
    high class at the new university Johns Hopkins consisted of
    only one student, G. B. Halsted, who had persisted in urging
    Sylvester to lecture on the modern algebra. The attempt to
    lecture on this subject led him into new investigations in
    quantics.—<span class="smcap">Cajori, F.</span></p>

    But for the persistence of a student of this

    new facts and principles which I
    have discovered in regard to it (important facts, I believe),
    would, so far as I am concerned, have remained still hidden in
    the womb of time. In vain I represented to this inquisitive
    student that he would do better to take up some other subject
    lying less off the beaten track of study, such as the higher
    parts of the calculus or elliptic functions, or the theory of
    substitutions, or I wot not what besides. He stuck with perfect
    respectfulness, but with invincible pertinacity, to his point.
    He would have the new algebra (Heaven knows where he had heard
    about it, for it is almost unknown in this continent), that or
    nothing. I was obliged to yield, and what was the consequence?
    In trying to throw light upon an obscure explanation in our
    text-book, my brain took fire, I plunged with re-quickened zeal
    into a subject which I had for years abandoned, and found food
    for thoughts which have engaged my attention for a considerable
    time past, and will probably occupy all my powers of
    contemplation advantageously for several months to
    come.—<span class="smcap">Sylvester, J. J.</span></p>

    Sylvester was incapable of reading mathematics in
    a purely receptive way. Apparently a subject either fired in
    his brain a train of active and restless thought, or it would
    not retain his attention at all. To a man of such a
    temperament, it would have been peculiarly helpful to live in
    an atmosphere in which his human associations would have
    supplied the stimulus which he could not find in mere reading.
    The great modern work in the theory of functions and in allied
    disciplines, he never became acquainted with....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    What would have been the effect if, in the prime of his powers,
    he had been surrounded by the influences which prevail in
    Berlin or in Göttingen? It may be confidently
    taken for granted that he would have done splendid work in
    those domains of analysis, which have furnished the laurels of
    the great mathematicians of Germany and France in the second
    half of the present century.—<span class=

    If we survey the mathematical works of Sylvester,
    we recognize indeed a considerable abundance, but in
    contradistinction to Cayley—not a
    versatility toward separate fields, but, with few
    exceptions—a confinement to
    arithmetic-algebraic branches....</p>

    The concept of <em>Function</em> of a continuous variable, the

    Sylvester’s <em>methods!</em> He
    had none. “Three lectures will be delivered
    on a New Universal Algebra,” he would say; then,
    “The course must be extended to twelve.” It did last all the
    rest of that year. The following year the course was to be
    <em>Substitutions-Theorie</em>, by Netto. We all got the text. He
    lectured about three times, following the text closely and
    stopping sharp at the end of the hour. Then he began to think
    about matrices again. “I must give one
    lecture a week on those,” he said. He could not
    confine himself to the hour, nor to the one lecture a week. Two
    weeks were passed, and Netto was forgotten entirely and never
    mentioned again. Statements like the following were not
    unfrequent in his lectures: “I
    haven’t proved this, but I am as sure as I
    can be of anything that it must be so. From this it will
    follow, etc.” At the next lecture it turned out
    that what he was so sure of was false. Never mind, he kept on
    forever guessing and trying, and presently a wonderful
    discovery followed, then another and another. Afterward he
    would go back and work it all over again, and surprise us with
    all sorts of side lights. He then made another leap in the
    dark, more treasures were discovered, and so on
    forever.—<span class="smcap">Davis, E. W.</span></p>

    I can see him [Sylvester] now, with his white
    beard and few locks of gray hair, his forehead wrinkled
    o’er with thoughts, writing rapidly his
    figures and formulae on the board, sometimes explaining as he
    wrote, while we, his listeners, caught

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_174"
      id="Page_174">174</a></span>

    the reflected sounds from the board. But stop, something is not
    right, he pauses, his hand goes to his forehead to help his
    thought, he goes over the work again, emphasizes the leading
    points, and finally discovers his difficulty. Perhaps it is
    some error in his figures, perhaps an oversight in the
    reasoning. Sometimes, however, the difficulty is not
    elucidated, and then there is not much to the rest of the
    lecture. But at the next lecture we would hear of some new
    discovery that was the outcome of that difficulty, and of some
    article for the Journal, which he had begun. If a text-book had
    been taken up at the beginning, with the intention of following
    it, that text-book was most likely doomed to oblivion for the
    rest of the term, or until the class had been made listeners to
    every new thought and principle that had sprung from the
    laboratory of his mind, in consequence of that first
    difficulty. Other difficulties would soon appear, so that no
    text-book could last more than half of the term. In this way
    his class listened to almost all of the work that subsequently
    appeared in the Journal. It seemed to be the quality of his
    mind that he must adhere to one subject. He would think about
    it, talk about it to his class, and finally write about it for
    the Journal. The merest accident might start him, but once
    started, every moment, every thought was given to it, and, as
    much as possible, he read what others had done in the same
    direction; but this last seemed to be his real point; he could
    not read without finding difficulties in the way of
    understanding the author. Thus, often his own work reproduced
    what had been done by others, and he did not find it out until
    too late.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    A notable example of this is in his theory of cyclotomic
    functions, which he had reproduced in several foreign journals,
    only to find that he had been greatly anticipated by foreign
    authors. It was manifest, one of the critics said, that the
    learned professor had not read Kummer’s
    elementary results in the theory of ideal primes. Yet Professor
    Smith’s report on the theory of numbers, which contained a full
    synopsis of Kummer’s theory, was Professor Sylvester’s constant
    companion.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    This weakness of Professor Sylvester, in not being able to read
    what others had done, is perhaps a concomitant of his peculiar
    genius. Other minds could pass over little difficulties and
    not be troubled by them, and so go on to a final understanding

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_175"
      id="Page_175">175</a></span>

    of the results of the author. But
    not so with him. A difficulty, however small, worried him, and
    he was sure to have difficulties until the subject had been
    worked over in his own way, to correspond with his own mode of
    thought. To read the work of others, meant therefore to him an
    almost independent development of it. Like the man whose
    pleasure in life is to pioneer the way for society into the
    forests, his rugged mind could derive satisfaction only in
    hewing out its own paths; and only when his efforts brought him
    into the uncleared fields of mathematics did he find his place
    in the Universe.—<span class= "smcap">Hathaway, A. S.</span></p>

    Professor Cayley has since informed me that the

    Schläfli’s “De Eliminatione.” This is not
    the first unconscious plagiarism I have been guilty of towards
    this eminent man whose friendship I am proud to claim. A more

    twenty-seven straight lines of cubic surfaces, where I believe
    I have followed (like one walking in his sleep), down to the
    very nomenclature and notation, the substance of a portion of a
    paper inserted by Schläfli in the “Mathematical Journal,” which
    bears my name as one of the editors upon the

    He [Sylvester] had one remarkable peculiarity. He
    seldom remembered theorems, propositions, etc., but had always
    to deduce them when he wished to use them. In this he was the
    very antithesis of Cayley, who was thoroughly conversant with
    everything that had been done in every branch of mathematics.</p>

    A short, broad man of tremendous vitality, the
    physical type of Hereward, the last of the English, and his
    brother-in-arms, Winter, Sylvester’s
    capacious head was ever lost in the highest cloud-lands of pure
    mathematics. Often in the dead of night he would get his
    favorite pupil, that he might communicate the very last product
    of his creative thought. Everything he saw suggested to him
    something new in the higher algebra. This transmutation of
    everything into new mathematics was a revelation to those who
    knew him intimately. They began to do it themselves. His ease
    and fertility of invention proved a constant encouragement,
    while his contempt for provincial stupidities, such as the

    flowery and eloquent. He was able to make the dullest subject
    bright, fresh and interesting. His enthusiasm is evident in
    every line. He would get quite close up to his subject, so that
    everything else looked small in comparison, and for the time
    would think and make others think that the world contained no
    finer matter for contemplation. His handwriting was bad, and a
    trouble to his printers. His papers were finished with
    difficulty. No sooner was the manuscript in the
    editor’s hands than alterations,
    corrections, ameliorations and generalizations would suggest
    themselves to his mind, and every post would carry further
    directions to the editors and
    printers.—<span class="smcap">MacMahon. P. A.</span></p>

    The enthusiasm of Sylvester for his own work, which manifests
    itself here as always, indicates one of his characteristic

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_177"
      id="Page_177">177</a></span>

    qualities: a high degree of
    <em>subjectivity</em> in his productions and publications.
    Sylvester was so fully possessed by the matter which for the
    time being engaged his attention, that it appeared to him and
    was designated by him as the summit of all that is important,
    remarkable and full of future promise. It would excite his
    phantasy and power of imagination in even a greater measure
    than his power of reflection, so much so that he could never
    marshal the ability to master his subject-matter, much less to
    present it in an orderly manner.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Considering that he was also somewhat of a poet, it will be
    easier to overlook the poetic flights which pervade his
    writing, often bombastic, sometimes furnishing apt
    illustrations; more damaging is the complete lack of form and
    orderliness of his publications and their sketchlike
    character,.... which must be accredited at least as much to
    lack of objectivity as to a superfluity of ideas. Again, the
    text is permeated with associated emotional expressions,
    bizarre utterances and paradoxes and is everywhere accompanied
    by notes, which constitute an essential part of
    Sylvester’s method of presentation,
    embodying relations, whether proximate or remote, which
    momentarily suggested themselves. These notes, full of
    inspiration and occasional flashes of genius, are the more
    stimulating owing to their incompleteness. But none of his
    works manifest a desire to penetrate the subject from all sides
    and to allow it to mature; each mere surmise, conceptions which
    arose during publication, immature thoughts and even errors
    were ushered into publicity at the moment of their inception,
    with utmost carelessness, and always with complete
    unfamiliarity of the literature of the subject. Nowhere is
    there the least trace of self-criticism. No one can be expected
    to read the treatises entire, for in the form in which they are
    available they fail to give a clear view of the matter under
    contemplation.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Sylvester’s was not a harmoniously gifted or
    well-balanced mind, but rather an instinctively active and
    creative mind, free from egotism. His reasoning moved in
    generalizations, was frequently influenced by analysis and at
    times was guided even by mystical numerical relations. His
    reasoning consists less frequently of pure intelligible
    conclusions than of inductions, or rather conjectures incited
    by individual observations and

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_178"
      id="Page_178">178</a></span>

    verifications. In this
    he was guided by an algebraic sense, developed through long
    occupation with processes of forms, and this led him luckily to
    general fundamental truths which in some instances remain
    veiled. His lack of system is here offset by the advantage of
    freedom from purely mechanical logical activity.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    The exponents of his essential characteristics are an intuitive
    talent and a faculty of invention to which we owe a series of
    ideas of lasting value and bearing the germs of fruitful
    methods. To no one more fittingly than to Sylvester can be
    applied one of the mottos of the Philosophic Magazine:</p>

    A certain rough Highland lad at the university had done
    exceedingly well, and at the close of the session gained prizes
    both in mathematics and in metaphysics. His old father came up
    from the farm to see his son receive the prizes, and visited
    the College. Thomson was deputed to show him round the place.
    “Weel, Mr. Thomson,” asked the old man, “and what may these
    mathematics be, for which my son has getten a prize?” “I told
    him,” replied Thomson, “that mathematics meant reckoning with
    figures, and calculating.” “Oo ay,” said the old man, “he’ll
    ha’ getten that fra’ me: I were ever a braw hand at the
    countin’.” After a pause he resumed: “And what, Mr. Thomson,
    might these metapheesics be?” “I endeavoured,” replied Thomson,
    “to explain how metaphysics was the attempt to express in
    language the indefinite.” The old Highlander stood still and
    scratched his head. “Oo ay: may be he’ll ha’ getten that fra’

    the night through and had not noticed the approach of daylight.
    When the director reminded him of the noisy throng of students

    Mathematics has a triple end. It should furnish an
    instrument for the study of nature. Furthermore it has a
    philosophic end, and, I venture to say, an end esthetic. It
    ought to incite the philosopher to search into the notions of
    number, space, and time; and, above all, adepts find in
    mathematics delights analogous to those that painting and music
    give. They admire the delicate harmony of number and of forms;
    they are amazed when a new discovery discloses for them an
    unlooked for perspective; and the joy they thus experience, has
    it not the esthetic character although the senses take no part
    in it? Only the privileged few are called to enjoy it fully, it
    is true; but is it not the same with all the noblest arts?
    Hence I do not hesitate to say that mathematics deserves to be
    cultivated for its own sake, and that the theories not
    admitting of application to physics deserve to be studied as
    well as others. <span class="smcap">Poincaré, Henri.</span></p>

    I like to look at mathematics almost more as an art than
    as a science; for the activity of the mathematician, constantly
    creating as he is, guided though not controlled by the external
    world of the senses, bears a resemblance, not fanciful I
    believe but real, to the activity of an artist, of a painter
    let us say. Rigorous deductive reasoning on the part of the
    mathematician may be likened here to technical skill in drawing
    on the part of the painter. Just as no one can become a good
    painter without a certain amount of skill, so no one can become
    a mathematician without the power to reason accurately up to a
    certain point. Yet these qualities, fundamental though they
    are, do not make a painter or mathematician worthy of the name,
    nor indeed are they the most important factors in the case.
    Other qualities of a far more subtle sort, chief among which in
    both cases is imagination, go to the making of a good artist or
    good mathematician.—<span class="smcap">Bôcher,

    Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only
    truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and
    austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of
    our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting
    or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection
    such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of
    delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man,
    which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be
    found in mathematics as surely as in poetry. What is best in
    mathematics deserves not merely to be learned as a task, but to
    be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again
    and again before the mind with ever-renewed encouragement. Real
    life is, to most men, a long second-best, a perpetual
    compromise between the real and the possible; but the world of
    pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no
    barrier to the creative activity embodying in splendid edifices
    the passionate aspiration after the perfect from which all
    great work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even
    from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have
    gradually created an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can
    dwell as in its natural home, and where one, at

    It was not alone the striving for universal

    such as Brunellesco, Leonardo de Vinci, Raphael, Michael Angelo
    and especially Albrecht Dürer, with irresistible
    power to the mathematical sciences. They were conscious that,
    with all the freedom of the individual phantasy, art is subject
    to necessary laws, and conversely, with all its rigor of
    logical structure, mathematics follows esthetic
    laws.—<span class="smcap">Rudio, F.</span></p>

    Surely the claim of mathematics to take a place
    among the liberal arts must now be admitted as fully made good.
    Whether we look at the advances made in modern geometry, in
    modern integral calculus, or in modern algebra, in each of
    these three a free handling of the material employed is now
    possible, and an almost unlimited scope is left to the
    regulated play of fancy. It seems to me that the whole of
    aesthetic (so far as at present revealed) may be regarded as a
    scheme having four centres, which may be treated as the four
    apices of a tetrahedron, namely Epic, Music, Plastic, and
    Mathematic. There will be found a <em>common</em> plane to every
    three of these, <em>outside</em> of which lies the fourth; and
    through every two may be drawn a common axis <em>opposite</em> to
    the axis passing through the other two. So far is certain and
    demonstrable. I think it also possible that there is a centre
    of gravity to each set of three, and that the line joining each
    such centre with the outside apex will intersect in a common
    point—the centre of gravity of the whole
    body of aesthetic; but what that centre is or must be I have
    not had time to think out.—<span class=

    for constructive art. Not every mathematician possesses in a

    Mathematics make the mind attentive to the objects

    great variety of truths, which are delightful and evident, but

    music to the ear and beauty to the eye. The pursuit of it does

    However far the calculating reason of the
    mathematician may seem separated from the bold flight of the
    artist’s phantasy, it must be remembered
    that these expressions are but momentary images snatched
    arbitrarily from among the activities of both. In the
    projection of new theories the mathematician needs as bold and
    creative a phantasy as the productive artist, and in the
    execution of the details of a composition the artist too must
    calculate dispassionately the means which are necessary for the
    successful consummation of the parts. Common to both is the

    a somewhat weak skeleton of conclusions characterizes the
    French; the English, above all Maxwell, are distinguished by
    the greatest dramatic bulk. Who does not know
    Maxwell’s dynamic theory of gases? At first
    there is the majestic development of the variations of
    velocities, then enter from one side the equations of condition
    and from the other the equations of central motions,—higher
    and higher surges the chaos of formulas,—suddenly four words
    burst forth: “Put n = 5.” The evil
    demon V disappears like the sudden ceasing of the basso parts
    in music, which hitherto wildly permeated the piece; what
    before seemed beyond control is now ordered as by magic. There
    is no time to state why this or that substitution was made, he
    who cannot feel the reason may as well lay the book aside;
    Maxwell is no program-musician who explains the notes of his
    composition. Forthwith the formulas yield obediently result

    Saturated with that speculative spirit then
    pervading the Greek mind, he [Pythagoras] endeavoured to
    discover some principle of homogeneity in the universe. Before
    him, the philosophers of the Ionic school had sought it in the
    matter of things; Pythagoras looked for it in the structure of
    things. He observed the various numerical relations or
    analogies between numbers and the phenomena of the universe.
    Being convinced that it was in numbers and their relations that
    he was to find the foundation to true philosophy, he proceeded
    to trace the origin of all things to numbers. Thus he observed
    that musical strings of equal lengths stretched by weights
    having the proportion of ½, ⅔, ¾, produced intervals
    which were an octave, a fifth and a fourth. Harmony, therefore,
    depends on musical proportion; it is nothing but a mysterious
    numerical relation. Where harmony is, there are numbers. Hence
    the order and beauty of the universe have their origin in
    numbers. There are seven intervals in the musical scale, and
    also seven planets crossing the heavens. The same numerical
    relations which underlie the former must underlie the latter.
    But where number is, there is harmony. Hence his spiritual ear
    discerned in the planetary motions a wonderful “Harmony of
    spheres”—<span class= "smcap">Cajori, F.</span></p>

    In my opinion, there is absolutely no trustworthy
    proof that talents have been improved by their exercise through
    the course of a long series of generations. The Bach family
    shows that musical talent, and the Bernoulli family that
    mathematical power, can be transmitted from generation to
    generation, but this teaches us nothing as to the origin of
    such talents. In both families the high-watermark of talent
    lies, not at the end of the series of generations, as it should
    do if the results of practice are transmitted, but in the
    middle. Again, talents frequently appear in some member of a
    family which has not been previously distinguished.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Gauss was not the son of a mathematician;
    Handel’s father was a surgeon, of whose
    musical powers nothing is known; Titian was the son and also
    the nephew of a lawyer, while he and his brother, Francesco
    Vecellio, were the first painters in a

    family which produced a succession of seven other artists with
    diminishing talents. These facts do not, however, prove that
    the condition of the nerve-tracts and centres of the brain,
    which determine the specific talent, appeared for the first
    time in these men: the appropriate condition surely existed
    previously in their parents, although it did not achieve
    expression. They prove, as it seems to me, that a high degree
    of endowment in a special direction, which we call talent,
    cannot have arisen from the experience of previous generations,
    that is, by the exercise of the brain in the same specific
    direction.—<span class="smcap">Weismann, August.</span></p>

    sharpness of definition, by which we
    are enabled to reason upon the symbols by the mere laws of
    verbal logic, discharging our minds entirely of the meaning of
    the symbols, until we have reached a stage of the process where
    we desire to interpret our results. The ability to attend to
    the symbols, and to perform the verbal, visible changes in the
    position of them permitted by the logical rules of the science,
    without allowing the mind to be perplexed with the meaning of
    the symbols until the result is reached which you wish to
    interpret, is a fundamental part of what is called analytical
    power. Many students find themselves perplexed by a perpetual
    attempt to interpret not only the result, but each step of the
    process. They thus lose much of the benefit of the labor-saving
    machinery of the calculus and are, indeed, frequently

    The prominent reason why a mathematician can be
    judged by none but mathematicians, is that he uses a peculiar
    language. The language of mathesis is special and
    untranslatable. In its simplest forms it can be translated, as,
    for instance, we say a right angle to mean a square corner. But
    you go a little higher in the science of mathematics, and it is
    impossible to dispense with a peculiar language. It would defy
    all the power of Mercury himself to explain to a person
    ignorant of the science what is meant by the single phrase
    “functional exponent.” How much
    more impossible, if we may say so, would it be to explain a
    whole treatise like Hamilton’s Quaternions,
    in such a wise as to make it possible to judge of its value!
    But to one who has learned this language, it is the most
    precise and clear of all modes of expression. It discloses the
    thought exactly as conceived by the writer, with more or less
    beauty of form, but never with obscurity. It may be prolix, as
    it often is among French writers; may delight in mere verbal
    metamorphoses, as in the Cambridge University of England; or
    adopt the briefest and clearest forms, as under the pens of the
    geometers of our Cambridge; but it always reveals to us
    precisely the writer’s
    thought.—<span class="smcap">Hill, Thomas.</span></p>

    than the invention of notation, and nothing of worse example

    Mathematics is often considered a difficult and

    employs. Of course, nothing is more incomprehensible than a
    symbolism which we do not understand. Also a symbolism, which
    we only partially understand and are unaccustomed to use, is
    difficult to follow. In exactly the same way the technical
    terms of any profession or trade are incomprehensible to those
    who have never been trained to use them. But this is not
    because they are difficult in themselves. On the contrary they
    have invariably been introduced to make things easy. So in
    mathematics, granted that we are giving any serious attention
    to mathematical ideas, the symbolism is invariably an immense
    simplification.—<span class="smcap">Whitehead, A. N.</span></p>

    Symbolism is useful because it makes things

    correctness. Hence we must invent a new and difficult symbolism
    in which nothing is obvious.... Thus the whole of Arithmetic

    Mathematics belongs to every inquiry, moral as

    rigidly bound, could not be deduced without its aid. The laws
    of argument admit of simple statement, but they must be

    speech and verified by observation. In its pure and simple form
    the syllogism cannot be directly compared with all experience,
    or it would not have required an Aristotle to discover it. It
    must be transmuted into all the possible shapes in which

    There are notable examples enough of demonstration
    outside of mathematics, and it may be said that Aristotle has
    already given some in his “Prior
    Analytics.” In fact logic is as susceptible of
    demonstration as geometry,.... Archimedes is the first, whose
    works we have, who has practised the art of demonstration upon
    an occasion where he is treating of physics, as he has done in
    his book on Equilibrium. Furthermore, jurists may be said to
    have many good demonstrations; especially the ancient Roman
    jurists, whose fragments have been preserved to us in the
    Pandects.—<span class="smcap">Leibnitz, G. W.</span></p>

    It is commonly considered that mathematics owes
    its certainty to its reliance on the immutable principles of
    formal logic. This ... is only half the truth imperfectly
    expressed. The other half would be that the principles of
    formal logic owe such a degree of permanence as they have
    largely to the fact that they have been tempered by long and
    varied use by mathematicians. “A vicious
    circle!” you will perhaps say. I should rather
    describe it as an example of the process known by
    mathematicians as the method of successive

    Whatever advantage can be attributed to logic in
    directing and strengthening the action of the understanding is
    found in a higher degree in mathematical study, with the
    immense added advantage of a determinate subject, distinctly
    circumscribed, admitting of the utmost precision, and free from
    the danger which is inherent in all abstract
    logic,—of leading to useless and puerile
    rules, or to vain ontological speculations. The positive
    method, being everywhere identical, is as much at home in the
    art of reasoning as anywhere else: and this is why no science,
    whether biology or any other, can offer any kind of reasoning,
    of which mathematics does not supply a simpler and purer
    counterpart. Thus, we are enabled to eliminate the only
    remaining portion of the old philosophy which could even appear
    to offer any real utility; the logical part, the value of which
    is irrevocably absorbed by mathematical
    science.—<span class="smcap">Comte, A.</span></p>

    The progress of the art of rational discovery
    depends in a great part upon the art of characteristic (ars

    The influence of the mathematics of Leibnitz upon
    his philosophy appears chiefly in connection with his law of
    continuity and his prolonged efforts to establish a Logical
    Calculus.... To find a Logical Calculus (implying a universal
    philosophical language or system of signs) is an attempt to
    apply in theological and philosophical investigations an
    analytic method analogous to that which had proved so
    successful in Geometry and Physics. It seemed to Leibnitz that
    if all the complex and apparently disconnected ideas which make
    up our knowledge could be analysed into their simple elements,
    and if these elements could each be represented by a definite
    sign, we should have a kind of “alphabet of
    human thoughts.” By the combination of these signs
    (letters of the alphabet of thought) a system of true knowledge
    would be built up, in which reality would be more and more
    adequately represented or symbolized.... In many cases the
    analysis may result in an infinite series of elements; but the
    principles of the Infinitesimal Calculus in mathematics have
    shown that this does not necessarily render calculation
    impossible or inaccurate. Thus it seemed to Leibnitz that a
    synthetic calculus, based upon a thorough analysis, would be
    the most effective instrument of knowledge that could be
    devised. “I feel,” he says, “that controversies can never be
    finished, nor silence imposed upon the Sects, unless we give up
    complicated reasonings in favor of simple <em>calculations</em>,
    words of vague and uncertain meaning in favor of fixed
    symbols.” Thus it will appear that “every paralogism is nothing
    but <em>an error of calculation</em>.” “When
    controversies arise, there will be no more necessity of
    disputation between two philosophers than between two
    accountants. Nothing will be needed but that they should take
    pen in hand, sit down with

    The discovery [of Ceres] was made by G. Piazzi of
    Palermo; and it was the more interesting as its announcement
    occurred simultaneously with a publication by Hegel in which he
    severely criticized astronomers for not paying more attention
    to philosophy, a science, said he, which would at once have
    shown them that there could not possibly be more than seven

        Mathematical teaching ... trains the mind to
    capacities, which ... are of the closest kin to those of the
    greatest metaphysician and philosopher. There is some color of
    truth for the opposite doctrine in the case of elementary
    algebra. The resolution of a common equation can be reduced to
    almost as mechanical a process as the working of a sum in
    arithmetic. The reduction of the question to an equation,
    however, is no mechanical operation, but one which, according
    to the degree of its difficulty, requires nearly every possible
    grade of ingenuity: not to speak of the new, and in the present
    state of the science insoluble, equations, which start up at
    every fresh step attempted in the application of mathematics to

    in the applicability not of its doctrines, but of its methods.
    Mathematics will ever remain the most perfect type of the
    Deductive Method in general; and the applications of
    mathematics to the simpler branches of physics, furnish the
    only school in which philosophers can effectually learn the
    most difficult and important portion of their art, the
    employment of the laws of the simpler phenomena for explaining
    and predicting those of the more complex. These grounds

    In metaphysical reasoning, the process is always

    the first principles or axioms on which it is grounded, and the
    different conclusions depend not one upon another.</p>

    It is otherwise in mathematical reasoning. Here the field has
    no limits. One proposition leads on to another, that to a
    third, and so on without end. If it should be asked, why
    demonstrative reasoning has so wide a field in mathematics,
    while, in other abstract subjects, it is confined within very
    narrow limits, I conceive this is chiefly owing to the nature
    of quantity, ... mathematical quantities being made up of parts
    without number, can touch in innumerable points, and be

    When ... I asked myself why was it then that the

    those who had studied mathematics, as if this science was the
    easiest of all and the one most necessary for preparing and

    suspected that they had knowledge of
    a mathematical science different from that of our time....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    I believe I find some traces of these true mathematics in
    Pappus and Diophantus, who, although they were not of extreme
    antiquity, lived nevertheless in times long preceding ours. But
    I willingly believe that these writers themselves, by a
    culpable ruse, suppressed the knowledge of them; like some
    artisans who conceal their secret, they feared, perhaps, that
    the ease and simplicity of their method, if become popular,
    would diminish its importance, and they preferred to make
    themselves admired by leaving to us, as the product of their
    art, certain barren truths deduced with subtlety, rather than
    to teach us that art itself, the knowledge of which would end
    our admiration.—<span class="smcap">Descartes.</span></p>

    If we rightly adhere to our rule [that is, that we
    should occupy ourselves only with those subjects in reference
    to which the mind is capable of acquiring certain and
    indubitable knowledge] there will remain but few things to the
    study of which we can devote ourselves. There exists in the
    sciences hardly a single question upon which men of
    intellectual ability have not held different opinions. But
    whenever two men pass contrary judgment on the same thing, it
    is certain that one of the two is wrong. More than that,
    neither of them has the truth; for if one of them had a clear
    and precise insight into it, he could so exhibit it to his
    opponent as to end the discussion by compelling his
    conviction.... It follows from this, if we reckon rightly, that

    The same reason which led Plato to recommend the
    study of arithmetic led him to recommend also the study of
    geometry. The vulgar crowd of geometricians, he says, will not

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>

    understand him. They have practice
    always in view. They do not know that the real use of the
    science is to lead men to the knowledge of abstract, essential,
    eternal truth. (Plato’s Republic, Book 7).
    Indeed if we are to believe Plutarch, Plato carried his feeling
    so far that he considered geometry as degraded by being applied
    to any purpose of vulgar utility. Archytas, it seems, had
    framed machines of extraordinary power on mathematical
    principles. (Plutarch, Sympos., VIII., and Life of Marcellus.
    The machines of Archytas are also mentioned by Aulus Gellius
    and Diogenes Laertius). Plato remonstrated with his friend, and
    declared that this was to degrade a noble intellectual exercise
    into a low craft, fit only for carpenters and wheelwrights. The
    office of geometry, he said, was to discipline the mind, not to
    minister to the base wants of the body. His interference was
    successful; and from that time according to Plutarch, the
    science of mechanics was considered unworthy of the attention
    of a philosopher.—<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>

    The intellectual habits of the Mathematicians are,
    in some respects, the same with those [of the Metaphysicians]
    we have been now considering; but, in other respects, they
    differ widely. Both are favourable to the improvement of the
    power of <em>attention</em>, but not in the same manner, nor in
    the same degree.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Those of the metaphysician give capacity of fixing the
    attention on the subjects of our consciousness, without being
    distracted by things external; but they afford little or no
    exercise to that species of attention which enables us to
    follow long processes of reasoning, and to keep in view all the
    various steps of an investigation till we arrive at the
    conclusion. In mathematics, such processes are much longer than
    in any other science; and hence the study of it is peculiarly
    calculated to strengthen the power of steady and concatenated
    thinking,—a power which, in all the pursuits
    of life, whether speculative or active, is one of the most
    valuable endowments we can possess. This command of attention,
    however, it may be proper to add, is to be acquired, not by the
    practice of modern methods, but by the study of Greek geometry,
    more particularly, by accustoming ourselves to pursue long
    trains of demonstration, without

    They [the Greeks] speculated and theorized under a
    lively persuasion that a Science of every part of nature was
    possible, and was a fit object for the exercise of a
    man’s best faculties; and they were speedily
    led to the conviction that such a science must clothe its
    conclusions in the language of mathematics. This conviction is
    eminently conspicuous in the writings of Plato.... Probably no
    succeeding step in the discovery of the Laws of Nature was of
    so much importance as the full adoption of this pervading
    conviction, that there must be Mathematical Laws of Nature, and
    that it is the business of Philosophy to discover these Laws.

    be learned in the schools of mathematicians, who, from very
    plain and easy beginnings, by gentle degrees, and a continued
    chain of reasonings, proceed to the discovery and demonstration
    of truths that appear at first sight beyond human capacity. The

    It is commonly asserted that mathematics and

    <em>objects</em>, the former treating of <em>quantity</em>, the
    latter of <em>quality</em>. All this is false. The difference
    between these sciences cannot depend on their object; for
    philosophy applies to everything, hence also to <em>quanta</em>,
    and so does mathematics in part, inasmuch as everything has
    magnitude. It is only the <em>different kind of rational
    knowledge or application</em> of reason in mathematics and
    philosophy which constitutes the specific difference between
    these two

 <span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_220"
      id="Page_220">220</a></span>

    sciences. For philosophy is
    <em>rational knowledge from mere concepts</em>, mathematics, on
    the contrary, is <em>rational knowledge from the construction of
    concepts</em>.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    We construct concepts when we represent them in intuition <i
    lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
    priori</i>, without experience, or when we represent in
    intuition the object which corresponds to our concept of
    it.—The mathematician can never apply his
    reason to mere concepts, nor the philosopher to the
    construction of concepts.—In mathematics the
    reason is employed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in concreto</i>,
    however, the intuition
    is not empirical, but the object of contemplation is something
    <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    In this, as we see, mathematics has an advantage over
    philosophy, the knowledge in the former being intuitive, in the
    latter, on the contrary, only <em>discursive</em>. But the reason
    why in mathematics we deal more with quantity lies in this,
    that magnitudes can be constructed in intuition <i lang="la"

    being represented in intuition.—<span class=

    Kant has divided human ideas into the two
    categories of quantity and quality, which, if true, would
    destroy the universality of Mathematics; but
    Descartes’ fundamental conception of the
    relation of the concrete to the abstract in Mathematics
    abolishes this division, and proves that all ideas of quality
    are reducible to ideas of quantity. He had in view geometrical
    phenomena only; but his successors have included in this
    generalization, first, mechanical phenomena, and, more
    recently, those of heat. There are now no geometers who do not
    consider it of universal application, and admit that every
    phenomenon may be as logically capable of being represented by
    an equation as a curve or a motion, if only we were always
    capable (which we are very far from being) of first
    discovering, and then resolving it.</p>

    The limitations of Mathematical science are not, then, in its

    The great advantage of the mathematical sciences

    distinction between them being immediately perceptible, and the
    same terms are still expressive of the same ideas, without
    ambiguity or variation. An oval is never mistaken for a circle,

    virtue, right or wrong. If any term be defined in geometry, the
    mind readily, of itself, substitutes on all occasions, the
    definition for the thing defined: Or even when no definition is
    employed, the object itself may be represented to the senses,
    and by that means be steadily and clearly apprehended. But the
    finer sentiments of the mind, the operations of the
    understanding, the various agitations of the passions, though
    really in themselves distinct, easily escape us, when surveyed
    by reflection; nor is it in our power to recall the original
    object, so often as we have occasion to contemplate it.
    Ambiguity, by this means, is gradually introduced into our
    reasonings: Similar objects are readily taken to be the same:
    And the conclusion becomes at last very wide off the
    premises.—<span class="smcap">Hume, David.</span></p>

    One part of these disadvantages in moral ideas
    which has made them be thought not capable of demonstration,
    may in a good measure be remedied by definitions, setting down
    that collection of simple ideas, which every term shall stand
    for; and then using the terms steadily and constantly for that
    precise collection. And what methods algebra, or something of
    that kind, may hereafter suggest, to remove the other
    difficulties, it is not easy to foretell. Confident, I am, that
    if men would in the same method, and with the same
    indifferency, search after moral as they do mathematical
    truths, they would find them have a stronger connexion one with
    another, and a more necessary consequence from our clear and
    distinct ideas, and to come nearer perfect demonstration than
    is commonly imagined.—<span class="smcap">Locke, John.</span></p>

  <p class="v2">
    <b><a name="Block_1440" id="Block_1440">1440</a>.</b>
    That which in this respect has given the advantage
    to the ideas of quantity, and made them thought more capable of
    certainty and demonstration [than moral ideas], is,</p>
  <p class="v1">
    First, That they can be set down and represented by sensible
    marks, which have a greater and nearer correspondence with them
    than any words or sounds whatsoever. Diagrams drawn on paper
    are copies of the ideas in the mind, and not liable to the
    uncertainty that words carry in their signification. An angle,
    circle, or square, drawn in lines, lies open to the view, and
    cannot be mistaken: it remains unchangeable, and may at leisure
    be considered and examined, and the demonstration be revised,
    and all the parts of it may be gone over more than once,
    without any danger of the least change in the ideas. This
    cannot be done in moral ideas: we have no sensible marks that
    resemble them, whereby we can set them down; we have nothing
    but words to express them by; which, though when written they
    remain the same, yet the ideas they stand for may change in the
    same man; and it is seldom that they are not different in
    different persons.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Secondly, Another thing that makes the greater difficulty in
    ethics is, That moral ideas are commonly more complex than
    those of the figures ordinarily considered in mathematics. From
    whence these two inconveniences
    follow:—First, that their names are of more
    uncertain signification, the precise collection of simple ideas
    they stand for not being so easily agreed on; and so the sign
    that is used for them in communication always, and in thinking
    often, does not steadily carry with it the same idea. Upon
    which the same disorder, confusion, and error follow, as would
    if a man, going to demonstrate something of an heptagon,
    should, in the diagram he took to do it, leave out one of the
    angles, or by oversight make the figure with an angle more than
    the name ordinarily imported, or he intended it should when at
    first he thought of his demonstration. This often happens, and
    is hardly avoidable in very complex moral ideas, where the same
    name being retained, an angle, i.e. one simple idea is left
    out, or put in the complex one (still called by the same name)
    more at one time than another. Secondly, From the complexedness
    of these moral ideas there follows another inconvenience, viz.,
    that the mind cannot easily retain

    those precise combinations so exactly and perfectly as is
    necessary in the examination of the habitudes and
    correspondences, agreements or disagreements, of several of
    them one with another; especially where it is to be judged of
    by long deductions and the intervention of several other
    complex ideas to show the agreement or disagreement of two
    remote ones.—<span class="smcap">Locke, John.</span></p>

    It has been generally taken for granted, that
    mathematics alone are capable of demonstrative certainty: but
    to have such an agreement or disagreement as may be intuitively
    perceived, being, as I imagine, not the privileges of the ideas
    of number, extension, and figure alone, it may possibly be the
    want of due method and application in us, and not of sufficient
    evidence in things, that demonstration has been thought to have
    so little to do in other parts of knowledge, and been scarce so
    much as aimed at by any but mathematicians. For whatever ideas
    we have wherein the mind can perceive the immediate agreement
    or disagreement that is between them, there the mind is capable
    of intuitive knowledge, and where it can perceive the agreement
    or disagreement of any two ideas, by an intuitive perception of
    the agreement or disagreement they have with any intermediate
    ideas, there the mind is capable of demonstration: which is not
    limited to the idea of extension, figure, number, and their
    modes.—<span class="smcap">Locke, John.</span></p>

    How comes it about that the knowledge of other

    this science itself? I should certainly be surprised, if I did

    necessity arise by a change of quantitative determinations, is
    either an empty play of thoughts, or at most a fruitless

    The mathematical formula is the point through
    which all the light gained by science passes in order to be of
    use to practice; it is also the point in which all knowledge
    gained by practice, experiment, and observation must be
    concentrated before it can be scientifically grasped. The more
    distant and marked the point, the more concentrated will be the
    light coming from it, the more unmistakable the insight
    conveyed. All scientific thought, from the simple gravitation
    formula of Newton, through the more complicated formulae of
    physics and chemistry, the vaguer so called laws of organic and
    animated nature, down to the uncertain statements of psychology
    and the data of our social and historical knowledge, alike
    partakes of this characteristic, that it is an attempt to
    gather up the scattered rays of light, the different parts of
    knowledge, in a focus, from whence it can be again spread out
    and analyzed, according to the abstract processes of the
    thinking mind. But only when this can be done with a
    mathematical precision and accuracy is the image sharp and
    well-defined, and the deductions clear and unmistakable. As we
    descend from the mechanical, through the physical, chemical,
    and biological, to the mental, moral, and social sciences, the
    process of focalization becomes less and less
    perfect,—the sharp point, the focus, is
    replaced by a larger or smaller circle, the contours of the
    image become less and less distinct, and with the possible
    light which we gain there is mingled much darkness, the sources
    of many mistakes and errors. But the tendency of all scientific
    thought is toward clearer and clearer definition; it lies in
    the direction of a more and more extended use of mathematical

    From the very outset of his investigations the

    mathematician, for even in the simplest cases, the direct
    results of his measuring operations are entirely without
    meaning until they have been submitted to more or less of
    mathematical discussion. And when in this way some

    also fulfill some other relation, that was previously

    Much of the skill of the true mathematical

    power of adapting methods and results carried out on an exact
    mathematical basis to obtain approximations sufficient for the
    purposes of physical measurements. It might perhaps be thought
    that a scheme of Mathematics on a frankly approximative basis
    would be sufficient for all the practical purposes of
    application in Physics, Engineering Science, and Astronomy, and
    no doubt it would be possible to develop, to some extent at
    least, a species of Mathematics on these lines. Such a system
    would, however, involve an intolerable awkwardness and
    prolixity in the statements of results, especially in view of
    the fact that the degree of approximation necessary for various
    purposes is very different, and thus that unassigned grades of
    approximation

    off from the chief sources of inspiration, the ideals of

    mathematical form. The history of the actual movements of
    mathematical thought through the centuries shows that these
    ideals are the very life-blood of the science, and warrants the
    conclusion that a constant striving toward their attainment is
    an absolutely essential condition of vigorous growth. These

    The immense part which those laws [laws of number

    other departments of physical science, is well known; and is
    not surprising, when we consider that all causes operate
    according to mathematical laws. The effect is always dependent
    upon, or in mathematical language, is a function of, the
    quantity of the agent; and generally of its position also. We
    cannot, therefore, reason respecting causation, without
    introducing considerations of quantity and extension at every
    step; and if the nature of the phenomena admits of our
    obtaining numerical data of sufficient accuracy, the laws of
    quantity become the grand instruments for calculating forward

    The ordinary mathematical treatment of any applied

    experience, and deduces from these axioms the rigid
    mathematical conclusions. In applying this method it must not
    be forgotten that the mathematical developments transcending
    the limits of exactness of the science are of no practical

    is only just beginning to apply the first derivative, i.e. the
    rate of change at which certain processes are going on; for

    The bond of union among the physical sciences is
    the mathematical spirit and the mathematical method which
    pervades them.... Our knowledge of nature, as it advances,
    continuously resolves differences of quality into differences
    of quantity. All exact reasoning—indeed all
    reasoning—about quantity is mathematical
    reasoning; and thus as our knowledge increases, that portion of
    it which becomes mathematical increases at a still more rapid

    Another way of convincing ourselves how largely
    this process [of assimilation of mathematics by physics] has
    gone on would be to try to conceive the effect of some
    intellectual catastrophe, supposing such a thing possible,
    whereby all knowledge of mathematics should be swept away from
    men’s minds. Would it not be that the
    departure of mathematics would be the destruction of physics?
    Objective physical phenomena would, indeed, remain as they are
    now, but physical science would cease to exist. We should no
    doubt see the same colours on looking into a spectroscope or
    polariscope, vibrating strings would produce the same sounds,
    electrical machines would give sparks, and galvanometer needles
    would be deflected; but all these things would have lost their
    meaning; they would be but as the dry bones—the <i lang="la"

    follow this conception further, and to try to image to ourselves

    which would remain possible, supposing all mathematical ideas

    would be extremely interesting, but it would lead us directly
    into a dim and entangled region where the subjective seems to be
    always passing itself off for the objective, and where I at
    least could not attempt to lead the way, gladly as I would
    follow any one who could show where a firm footing is to be
    found. But without venturing to do more than to look from a
    safe distance over this puzzling ground, we may see clearly

    In <em>Plato’s</em> time
    mathematics was purely a play of the free intellect; the
    mathematic-mystical reveries of a Pythagoras foreshadowed a
    far-reaching significance, but such a significance (except in
    the case of music) was as yet entirely a matter of fancy; yet
    even in that time mathematics was the prerequisite to all other
    studies! But today, when mathematics furnishes the <em>only</em>
    language by means of which we may formulate the most
    comprehensive laws of nature, laws which the ancients scarcely
    dreamed of, when moreover mathematics is the <em>only</em> means
    by which these laws may be understood,—how
    few learn today anything of the real essence of our
    mathematics!... In the schools of today mathematics serves only
    as a disciplinary study, a mental gymnastic; that it includes
    the highest ideal value for the comprehension of the universe,

    In such cases the mathematician can
    often point out some other problem more accessible to
    experimental treatment, the solution of which involves the
    solution of the former one. For example, if we try to deduce
    from direct experiments the law according to which one pole of
    a magnet attracts or repels a pole of another magnet, the
    observed action is so much complicated with the effects of the
    mutual induction of the magnets and of the forces due to the
    second pole of each magnet, that it is next to impossible to
    obtain results of any great accuracy. Gauss, however, showed
    how the law which applied in the case mentioned can be deduced
    from the deflections undergone by a small suspended magnetic
    needle when it is acted upon by a small fixed magnet placed
    successively in two determinate positions relatively to the
    needle; and being an experimentalist as well as a

    During the last two centuries and a half, physical

    had not before. It has become <em>mathematical</em>. The question
    now is, not whether this or that hypothesis is better or worse

    phenomena in those consequences which can be shown necessarily
    to follow from it, if it be true. Even in those sciences which
    are not yet under the dominion of mathematics, and perhaps
    never will be, a working copy of the mathematical process has
    been made. This is not known to the followers of those sciences

    Something has been said about the use of

    obtaining untrustworthy results in physical science, if only
    the results of mathematics are used; for the person so using

    which it can be rightly applied.... The results are often

    such a worker until a result has been otherwise tested.
    Moreover, such a practice in the use of mathematics leads a

    require mathematics. And the arguments which are used to
    establish this doctrine, show a most just appreciation of the
    office of mathematics in science. They are such as follows:
    That other sciences use examples taken from mathematics as the
    most evident:—That mathematical knowledge is, as it were,
    innate to us, on which point he refers to the well-known
    dialogue of Plato, as quoted by Cicero:—That this science,
    being the easiest, offers the best introduction to the more
    difficult:—That in mathematics, things as known to us are
    identical with things as known to nature:—That we can here
    entirely avoid doubt and error, and obtain certainty and
    truth:—That mathematics is prior to other sciences in nature,
    because it takes cognizance of quantity, which is apprehended
    by intuition (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intuitu

    differential equations proper to the
    phenomena is, independent of their integration, a very
    important acquisition, on account of the approximations which
    mathematical analysis allows between questions, otherwise
    heterogeneous, which lead to similar equations. This
    fundamental property, whose value we have so often to
    recognize, applies remarkably in the present case; and
    especially since the creation of mathematical thermology, whose
    principal equations are strongly analogous to those of
    vibratory motion.—This means of
    investigation is all the more valuable on account of the
    difficulties in the way of direct inquiry into the phenomena of
    sound. We may decide the necessity of the atmospheric medium
    for the transmission of sonorous vibrations; and we may
    conceive of the possibility of determining by experiment the
    duration of the propagation, in the air, and then through other
    media; but the general laws of the vibrations of sonorous
    bodies escape immediate observation. We should know almost
    nothing of the whole case if the mathematical theory did not
    come in to connect the different phenomena of sound, enabling
    us to substitute for direct observation an equivalent
    examination of more favorable cases subjected to the same law.
    For instance, when the analysis of the problem of vibrating
    chords has shown us that, other things being equal, the number
    of oscillations is in inverse proportion to the length of the
    chord, we see that the most rapid vibrations of a very short
    chord may be counted, since the law enables us to direct our
    attention to very slow vibrations. The same substitution is at
    our command in many cases in which it is less
    direct.—<span class="smcap">Comte, A.</span></p>

    The discovery of this planet [Neptune] is justly

    Uranus failed to move precisely in the path which the computers
    predicted for it, and was misguided by some unknown influence
    to an extent which a keen eye might almost see without
    telescopic aid.... These minute discrepancies constituted the
    data which were found sufficient for calculating the position
    of a hitherto unknown planet, and bringing it to light.

    “<em>Direct your telescope to a point on the

    place a new planet, looking like a star of about the ninth
    magnitude, and having a perceptible disc.</em>” The
    planet was found at Berlin on the night of Sept. 26, 1846, in
    exact accordance with this prediction, within half an hour
    after the astronomers began looking for it, and only about

    The long series of connected truths which compose
    the science of astronomy, have been evolved from the
    appearances and observations by calculation, and a process of
    reasoning entirely geometrical. It was not without reason that
    Plato called geometry and arithmetic the wings of astronomy;
    for it is only by means of these two sciences that we can give
    a rational account of any of the appearances, or connect any
    fact with theory, or even render a single observation available
    to the most common astronomical purpose. It is by geometry that
    we are enabled to reason our way up through the apparent
    motions to the real orbits of the planets, and to assign their
    positions, magnitudes and eccentricities. And it is by
    application of geometry—a sublime geometry,
    indeed, invented for the purpose—to the
    general laws of mechanics, that we demonstrate the law of
    gravitation, trace it through its remotest effects on the
    different planets, and, comparing these effects with what we
    observe, determine the densities and weights of the minutest
    bodies belonging to the system. The whole science of astronomy
    is in fact a tissue of geometrical reasoning, applied to the
    data of observation; and it is from this circumstance that it
    derives its peculiar character of precision and certainty. To
    disconnect it from geometry, therefore, and to substitute
    familiar illustrations and vague description for close and
    logical reasoning, is to deprive it of its principal
    advantages,

    find it very difficult to supply, if he voluntarily undertakes
    to forego its assistance. Few undertakings, indeed, are

    almost said all, Arts, the unshaken Foundation of Sciences, and
    the plentiful Fountain of Advantage to Human Affairs. In which
    last Respect, we may be said to receive from the
    <em>Mathematics</em>, the principal Delights of Life, Securities
    of Health, Increase of Fortune, and Conveniences of Labour:
    That we dwell elegantly and commodiously, build decent Houses
    for ourselves, erect stately Temples to God, and leave
    wonderful Monuments to Posterity: That we are protected by
    those Rampires from the Incursions of the Enemy; rightly use
    Arms, skillfully range an Army, and manage War by Art, and not
    by the Madness of wild Beasts: That we have safe Traffick
    through the deceitful Billows, pass in a direct Road through
    the tractless Ways of the Sea, and come to the designed Ports
    by the uncertain Impulse of the Winds: That we rightly cast up
    our Accounts, do Business expeditiously, dispose,
    tabulate, and calculate scattered

    Ranks of Numbers, and easily
    compute them, though expressive of huge Heaps of Sand, nay
    immense Hills of Atoms: That we make pacifick Separations of
    the Bounds of Lands, examine the Moments of Weights in an equal
    Balance, and distribute every one his own by a just Measure:
    That with a light Touch we thrust forward vast Bodies which way
    we will, and stop a huge Resistance with a very small Force:
    That we accurately delineate the Face of this Earthly Orb, and
    subject the Oeconomy of the Universe to our Sight: That we
    aptly digest the flowing Series of Time, distinguish what is
    acted by due Intervals, rightly account and discern the various
    Returns of the Seasons, the stated Periods of Years and Months,
    the alternate Increments of Days and Nights, the doubtful
    Limits of Light and Shadow, and the exact Differences of Hours
    and Minutes: That we derive the subtle Virtue of the Solar Rays
    to our Uses, infinitely extend the Sphere of Sight, enlarge the
    near Appearances of Things, bring to Hand Things remote,
    discover Things hidden, search Nature out of her Concealments,
    and unfold her dark Mysteries: That we delight our Eyes with
    beautiful Images, cunningly imitate the Devices and portray the
    Works of Nature; imitate did I say? nay excel, while we form to
    ourselves Things not in being, exhibit Things absent, and
    represent Things past: That we recreate our Minds and delight
    our Ears with melodious Sounds, attemperate the inconstant
    Undulations of the Air to musical Tunes, add a pleasant Voice
    to a sapless Log and draw a sweet Eloquence from a rigid Metal;
    celebrate our Maker with an harmonious Praise, and not unaptly
    imitate the blessed Choirs of Heaven: That we approach and
    examine the inaccessible Seats of the Clouds, the distant
    Tracts of Land, unfrequented Paths of the Sea; lofty Tops of
    the Mountains, low Bottoms of the Valleys, and deep Gulphs of
    the Ocean: That in Heart we advance to the Saints themselves
    above, yea draw them to us, scale the etherial Towers, freely
    range through the celestial Fields, measure the Magnitudes, and
    determine the Interstices of the Stars, prescribe inviolable
    Laws to the Heavens themselves, and confine the wandering
    Circuits of the Stars within fixed Bounds: Lastly, that we

    <em>Where there is nothing to measure there is
    nothing to calculate</em>, hence it is impossible to employ
    mathematics in psychological investigations. Thus runs the
    syllogism compounded of an adherence to usage and an apparent
    truth. As to the latter, it is wholly untrue that we may
    calculate only where we have measured. Exactly the opposite is
    true. Every hypothetically assumed law of quantitative
    combination, even such as is recognized as invalid, is subject
    to calculation; and in case of deeply hidden but important
    matters it is imperative to try on hypotheses and to subject
    the consequences which flow from them to precise computation
    until it is found which one of the various hypotheses coincides
    with experience. Thus the ancient astronomers <em>tried</em>
    eccentric circles, and Kepler

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_251"
      id="Page_251">251</a></span>

    <em>tried</em> the
    ellipse to account for the motion of the planets, the latter
    also compared the squares of the times of revolution with the
    cubes of the mean distances before he discovered their
    agreement. In like manner Newton <em>tried</em> whether a
    gravitation, varying inversely as the square of the distance,
    sufficed to keep the moon in its orbit about the earth; if this
    supposition had failed him, he would have tried some other
    power of the distance, as the fourth or fifth, and deduced the
    corresponding consequences to compare them with the
    observations. Just this is the greatest benefit of mathematics,
    that it enables us to survey the possibilities whose range
    includes the actual, long before we have adequate definite
    experience; this makes it possible to employ very incomplete
    indications of experience to avoid at least the crudest errors.
    Long before the transit of Venus was employed in the
    determination of the sun’s parallax, it was
    attempted to determine the instant at which the sun illumines
    exactly one-half of the moon’s disk, in
    order to compute the sun’s distance from the
    known distance of the moon from the earth. This was not
    possible, for, owing to psychological reasons, our method of
    measuring time is too crude to give us the desired instant with
    sufficient accuracy; yet the attempt gave us the knowledge that
    the sun’s distance from us is at least
    several hundred times as great as that of the moon. This
    illustration shows clearly that even a very imperfect estimate
    of a magnitude in a case where no precise observation is
    possible, may become very instructive, if we know how to
    exploit it. Was it necessary to know the scale of our solar
    system in order to learn of its order in general? Or, taking an
    illustration from another field, was it impossible to
    investigate the laws of motion until it was known exactly how
    far a body falls in a second at some definite place? Not at
    all. Such determinations of <em>fundamental measures</em> are in
    themselves exceedingly difficult, but fortunately, such
    investigations form a class of their own; our knowledge of
    <em>fundamental laws</em> does not need to wait on these. To be
    sure, computation invites measurement, and every easily
    observed regularity of certain magnitudes is an incentive to
    mathematical investigation.—<span class=

    However hurtful may have been the incursions of
    the geometers, direct and indirect, into a domain which it is
    not for them to cultivate, the physiologists are not the less
    wrong in turning away from mathematics altogether. It is not
    only that without mathematics they could not receive their due
    preliminary training in the intervening sciences: it is further
    necessary for them to have geometrical and mechanical
    knowledge, to understand the structure and the play of the
    complex apparatus of the living, and especially the animal
    organism. Animal mechanics, statical and dynamical, must be
    unintelligible to those who are ignorant of the general laws of
    rational mechanics. The laws of equilibrium and motion are ...
    absolutely universal in their action, depending wholly on the
    energy, and not at all on the nature of the forces considered:
    and the only difficulty is in their numerical application in
    cases of complexity. Thus, discarding all idea of a numerical
    application in biology, we perceive that the general theorems
    of statics and dynamics must be steadily verified in the
    mechanism of living bodies, on the rational study of which they
    cast an indispensable light. The highest orders of animals act
    in repose and motion, like any other mechanical apparatus of a
    similar complexity, with the one difference of the mover, which
    has no power to alter the laws of motion and equilibrium. The
    participation of rational mechanics in positive biology is thus
    evident. Mechanics cannot dispense with geometry; and beside,
    we see how anatomical and physiological speculations involve
    considerations of form and position, and require a familiar
    knowledge of the principal geometrical laws which may cast
    light upon these complex
    relations.—<span class="smcap">Comte,A.</span></p>

    In this school [of mathematics] must they
    [biologists] learn familiarly the real characters and
    conditions of scientific evidence, in order to transfer it
    afterwards to the province of their own theories. The study of
    it here, in the most simple and perfect cases, is the only
    sound preparation for its recognition in the most complex.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    The study is equally necessary for the formation of
    intellectual habits; for obtaining an aptitude in forming and
    sustaining positive abstractions, without which the comparative
    method cannot be used in either anatomy or physiology. The
    abstraction which is to be the standard of comparison must be
    first clearly formed, and then steadily maintained in its
    integrity, or the analysis becomes abortive: and this is so
    completely in the spirit of mathematical combinations, that
    practice in them is the best preparation for it. A student who
    cannot accomplish the process in the more simple case may be
    assured that he is not qualified for the higher order of
    biological researches, and must be satisfied with the humbler
    office of collecting materials for the use of minds of another
    order. Hence arises another use of mathematical
    training;—that of testing and classifying
    minds, as well as preparing and guiding them. Probably as much
    good would be done by excluding the students who only encumber
    the science by aimless and desultory inquiries, as by fitly
    instituting those who can better fulfill its
    conditions.—<span class="smcap">Comte, A.</span></p>

    There seems no sufficient reason why the use of
    scientific fictions, so common in the hands of geometers,
    should not be introduced into biology, if systematically
    employed, and adopted with sufficient sobriety. In mathematical
    studies, great advantages have arisen from imagining a series
    of hypothetical cases, the consideration of which, though
    artificial, may aid the clearing up of the real subject, or its
    fundamental elaboration. This art is usually confounded with
    that of hypotheses; but it is entirely different; inasmuch as
    in the latter case the solution alone is imaginary; whereas in
    the former, the problem itself is radically ideal. Its use can
    never be in biology comparable to what it is in mathematics:
    but it seems to me that

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_254"
      id="Page_254">254</a></span>

    the abstract character of the
    higher conceptions of comparative biology renders them
    susceptible of such treatment. The process will be to
    intercalate, among different known organisms, certain purely
    fictitious organisms, so imagined as to facilitate their
    comparison, by rendering the biological series more homogeneous
    and continuous: and it might be that several might hereafter
    meet with more or less of a realization among organisms
    hitherto unexplored. It may be possible, in the present state
    of our knowledge of living bodies, to conceive of a new
    organism capable of fulfilling certain given conditions of
    existence. However that may be, the collocation of real cases
    with well-imagined ones, after the manner of geometers, will
    doubtless be practised hereafter, to complete the general laws
    of comparative anatomy and physiology, and possibly to
    anticipate occasionally the direct exploration. Even now, the
    rational use of such an artifice might greatly simplify and
    clear up the ordinary system of biological instruction. But it
    is only the highest order of investigators who can be trusted
    with it. Whenever it is adopted, it will constitute another

    The calculus of probabilities, when confined
    within just limits, ought to interest, in an equal degree, the
    mathematician, the experimentalist, and the statesman. From the
    time when Pascal and Fermat established its first principles,
    it has rendered, and continues daily to render, services of the
    most eminent kind. It is the calculus of probabilities, which,
    after having suggested the best arrangements of the tables of
    population and mortality, teaches us to deduce from those
    numbers, in general so erroneously interpreted, conclusions of
    a precise and useful character; it is the calculus of
    probabilities which alone can regulate justly the premiums to
    be paid for assurances; the reserve funds for the disbursements
    of pensions, annuities, discounts, etc. It is under its
    influence that lotteries and other shameful snares cunningly

    That <em>arithmetic</em> rests on pure intuition of

    intuition of space, but it may be readily proved as follows.
    All counting consists in the repeated positing of unity; only
    in order to know how often it has been posited, we mark it each
    time with a different word: these are the numerals. Now
    repetition is possible only through succession: but succession
    rests on the immediate intuition of <em>time</em>, it is
    intelligible only by means of this latter concept: hence
    counting is possible only by means of time.—This dependence
    of counting on <em>time</em> is evidenced by the fact that in
    all languages multiplication is expressed by “times” [mal],

    On the one side we may say that the purpose of
    number work is to put a child in possession of the machinery of
    calculation; on the other side it is to give him a better
    mastery of the world through a clear (mathematical) insight
    into the varied physical objects and activities. The whole
    world, from one point of view, can be definitely interpreted
    and appreciated by mathematical measurements and estimates.
    Arithmetic in the common school should give a child this point
    of view, the ability to see and estimate things with a
    mathematical eye.—<span

    We are so accustomed to hear arithmetic spoken of
    as one of the three fundamental ingredients in all schemes of
    instruction, that it seems like inquiring too curiously to ask
    why this should be. Reading, Writing, and
    Arithmetic—these three are assumed to be of
    co-ordinate rank. Are they indeed co-ordinate, and if so on
    what grounds?</p>
  <p class="v1">
    In this modern “trivium” the art
    of reading is put first. Well, there is no doubt as to its
    right to the foremost place. For reading is the instrument of
    all our acquisition. It is indispensable. There is not an hour
    in our lives in which it does not make a great difference to us
    whether we can read or not. And the art of Writing, too; that
    is the instrument of all communication, and it becomes, in one
    form or other, useful to us every day. But Counting—doing
    sums,—how
    often in life does this accomplishment come into exercise?
    Beyond the simplest additions, and the power to check the items
    of a bill, the arithmetical knowledge required of any
    well-informed person in private life is very limited. For all
    practical purposes, whatever I may have learned at school of
    fractions, or proportion, or decimals, is, unless I happen to
    be in business, far less available to me in life than a
    knowledge, say, of history of my own country, or the elementary
    truths of physics. The truth is, that regarded as practical
    <em>arts</em>, reading, writing, and arithmetic have no right to
    be classed together as co-ordinate elements of education; for
    the last of these is considerably less useful to the average
    man or woman not only than the other two, but than

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_267"
      id="Page_267">267</a></span>

    many others that might be named. But reading, writing, and such
    mathematical or logical exercise as may be gained in connection
    with the manifestation of numbers, <em>have</em> a right to
    constitute the primary elements of instruction. And I believe
    that arithmetic, if it deserves the high place that it
    conventionally holds in our educational system, deserves it
    mainly on the ground that it is to be treated as a logical
    exercise. It is the only branch of mathematics which has found
    its way into primary and early education; other departments of
    pure science being reserved for what is called higher or
    university instruction. But all the arguments in favor of
    teaching algebra and trigonometry to advanced students, apply
    equally to the teaching of the principles or theory of
    arithmetic to schoolboys. It is calculated to do for them
    exactly the same kind of service, to educate one side of their
    minds, to bring into play one set of faculties which cannot be
    so severely or properly exercised in any other department of
    learning. In short, relatively to the needs of a beginner,
    Arithmetic, as a science, is just as valuable—it is certainly
    quite as intelligible—as the higher mathematics to a university
    student.—<span class="smcap">Fitch, J. G.</span></p>

    What mathematics, therefore are expected to do for
    the advanced student at the university, Arithmetic, if taught
    demonstratively, is capable of doing for the children even of
    the humblest school. It furnishes training in reasoning, and
    particularly in deductive reasoning. It is a discipline in
    closeness and continuity of thought. It reveals the nature of
    fallacies, and refuses to avail itself of unverified
    assumptions. It is the one department of school-study in which
    the sceptical and inquisitive spirit has the most legitimate
    scope; in which authority goes for nothing. In other
    departments of instruction you have a right to ask for the
    scholar’s confidence, and to expect many
    things to be received on your testimony with the understanding
    that they will be explained and verified afterwards. But here
    you are justified in saying to your pupil
    “Believe nothing which you cannot
    understand. Take nothing for granted.” In short,
    the proper office of arithmetic is to serve as elementary

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_268"
      id="Page_268">268</a></span>

    training in logic. All through your
    work as teachers you will bear in mind the fundamental
    difference between knowing and thinking; and will feel how much
    more important relatively to the health of the intellectual
    life the habit of thinking is than the power of knowing, or
    even facility of achieving visible results. But here this
    principle has special significance. It is by Arithmetic more
    than by any other subject in the school course that the art of
    thinking—consecutively, closely, logically—can be effectually
    taught.—<span class="smcap">Fitch, J. G.</span></p>

    Arithmetic and geometry are much more certain than
    the other sciences, because the objects of them are in
    themselves so simple and so clear that they need not suppose
    anything which experience can call in question, and both
    proceed by a chain of consequences which reason deduces one
    from another. They are also the easiest and clearest of all the
    sciences, and their object is such as we desire; for, except
    for want of attention, it is hardly supposable that a man
    should go astray in them. We must not be surprised, however,
    that many minds apply themselves by preference to other
    studies, or to philosophy. Indeed everyone allows himself more
    freely the right to make his guess if the matter be dark than
    if it be clear, and it is much easier to have on any question
    some vague ideas than to arrive at the truth itself on the

    The clearness and distinctness of each mode of
    number from all others, even those that approach nearest, makes
    me apt to think that demonstrations in numbers, if they are not
    more evident and exact than in extension, yet they are more
    general in their use, and more determinate in their
    application. Because the ideas of numbers are more precise and
    distinguishable than in extension; where every equality and
    excess are not so easy to be observed or measured; because our
    thoughts cannot in space arrive at any determined smallness

    more quickly and with a greater degree of accuracy; for the

    The existence of such a machine proves that computation is not

    for it is only these that the machine can obey—having been thus

    The science of algebra, independently of any of
    its uses, has all the advantages which belong to mathematics in
    general as an object of study, and which it is not necessary to
    enumerate. Viewed either as a science of quantity, or as a
    language of symbols, it may be made of the greatest service to
    those who are sufficiently acquainted with arithmetic, and who
    have sufficient power of comprehension to enter fairly upon its
    difficulties.—<span class="smcap">De Morgan, A.</span></p>

    The laws of algebra, though suggested by
    arithmetic, do not depend on it. They depend entirely on the
    conventions by which it is stated that certain modes of
    grouping the symbols are to be considered as identical. This
    assigns certain properties to the marks which form the symbols
    of algebra. The laws regulating the manipulation of algebraic
    symbols are identical with those of arithmetic. It follows that
    no algebraic theorem can ever contradict any result which could
    be arrived at by arithmetic; for the reasoning in both cases
    merely applies the same general laws to different classes of
    things. If an algebraic theorem can be interpreted in
    arithmetic, the corresponding arithmetical theorem is therefore
    true.—<span class="smcap">Whitehead, A. N.</span></p>

    The circumstances that algebra has its origin in

    science, led Sir Isaac Newton to designate it
    “Universal Arithmetic,” a
    designation which, vague as it is, indicates its character
    better than any other by which it has been attempted to express
    its functions—better certainly, to ordinary

    William Rowan Hamilton, one of the greatest mathematicians the
    world has seen since the days of Newton—“the Science of Pure

    If nothing more could be said of Quaternions than
    that they enable us to exhibit in a singularly compact and
    elegant form, whose meaning is obvious at a glance on account
    of the utter inartificiality of the method, results which in
    the ordinary Cartesian co-ordinates are of the utmost
    complexity, a very powerful argument for their use would be
    furnished. But it would be unjust to Quaternions to be content
    with such a statement; for we are fully entitled to say that in
    <em>all</em> cases, even in those to which the Cartesian methods
    seem specially adapted, they give as simple an expression as
    any other method; while in the great majority of cases they
    give a vastly simpler one. In the common methods a judicious
    choice of co-ordinates is often of immense importance in
    simplifying an investigation; in Quaternions there is usually
    <em>no choice</em>, for (except when they degrade to mere
    scalars) they are in general utterly independent of any
    particular directions in space, and select of themselves the
    most natural reference lines for each particular

    This symbol [√−1] is
    restricted to a precise signification as the representative of
    perpendicularity in quaternions, and this wonderful algebra of
    space is intimately dependent upon the special use of the
    symbol for its symmetry, elegance, and power. The immortal
    author of quaternions has shown that there are other
    significations which may attach to the symbol in other cases.
    But the strongest use of the symbol is to be found in its
    magical power of doubling the actual universe, and placing by
    its side an ideal universe, its exact counterpart, with which

    All the fruitful uses of imaginaries, in Geometry,
    are those which begin and end with real quantities, and use
    imaginaries only for the intermediate steps. Now in all such
    cases, we have a real spatial interpretation at the beginning
    and end of our argument, where alone the spatial interpretation
    is important; in the intermediate links, we are dealing in
    purely algebraic manner with purely algebraic quantities, and
    may perform any operations which are algebraically permissible.
    If the quantities with which we end are capable of spatial
    interpretation, then, and only then, our results may be
    regarded as geometrical. To use geometrical language, in any
    other case, is only a convenient help to the imagination. To
    speak, for example, of projective properties which refer to the
    circular points, is a mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">memoria
    technica</i> for purely
    algebraical properties; the circular points are not to be found
    in space, but only in the auxiliary quantities by which
    geometrical equations are transformed. That no contradictions
    arise from the geometrical interpretation of imaginaries is not
    wonderful; for they are interpreted solely by the rules of
    Algebra, which we may admit as valid in their interpretation to
    imaginaries. The perception of space being wholly absent,
    Algebra rules supreme, and no inconsistency can
    arise.—<span class="smcap">Russell, Bertrand.</span></p>

    In every subject of inquiry there are certain
    entities, the mutual relations of which, under various
    conditions, it is desirable to ascertain. A certain combination
    of these entities are submitted to certain processes or are
    made the subjects of certain operations. The theory of
    invariants in its widest scientific meaning determines these
    combinations, elucidates their properties, and expresses
    results when possible in terms of them. Many of the general
    principles of political science and economics can be
    represented by means of invariantive relations connecting the
    factors which enter as entities into the special problems. The
    great principle of chemical science which asserts that when
    elementary or compound bodies combine with one another the
    total weight of the materials is unchanged, is another case in
    point. Again, in physics, a given mass of gas under the
    operation of varying pressure and temperature has the
    well-known invariant, pressure multiplied by volume and divided
    by absolute temperature.... In mathematics the entities under
    examination may be arithmetical, algebraical, or geometrical;
    the processes to which they are subjected may be any of those
    which are met with in mathematical work.... It is the
    <em>principle</em> which is so valuable. It is the <em>idea</em> of

    Let me mention one other contribution which this
    theory [Theory of functions of a complex variable] has made to
    knowledge lying somewhat outside our track. During the rigorous
    revision to which the foundations of the theory have been
    subjected in its re-establishment by Weierstrass, new ideas as
    regards number and continuity have been introduced. With him
    and with others influenced by him, there has thence sprung a
    new theory of higher arithmetic; and with its growth, much has
    concurrently been effected in the elucidation of the general
    notions of number and quantity.... It thus appears to be the
    fact that, as with Plato, or Descartes, or Leibnitz, or Kant,
    the activity of pure mathematics is again lending some
    assistance to the better comprehension of those notions of
    time, space, number, quantity, which underlie a philosophical
    conception of the universe.—<span class=

    At present the science [of geometry] is in flat

    hardly be denied by those who have any acquaintance with the

    it contained a body of knowledge that was really known and

    application. For even at the time this book was written—shortly
    after the foundation of the Alexandrian Museum—Mathematics was
    no longer the merely ideal science of the Platonic school, but
    had started on her career of conquest over the whole world of
    Phenomena. The guide; for the aim of every scientific student
    of every subject was to bring his knowledge of that subject
    into a form as perfect as that which geometry had attained. Far
    up on the great mountain of Truth, which all the sciences hope

    well as plane; not demonstration, but to make acquaintance.
    Then not Euclid, but elementary vectors, conjoined with
    algebra, and applied to geometry. Addition first; then the
    scalar product. Elementary calculus should go on
    simultaneously, and come into the vector algebraic geometry

    the forms of expression which were adopted in the old geometry
    has led to the total exclusion of this part of the elements

    [ratio], a first to a second, and a third to a fourth, when the
    Equimultiples of the first and third according to any
    Multiplication whatsoever are both together either short of,
    equal to, or exceed the Equimultiples of the second and fourth,
    if those be taken, which answer one another.... Such is

    Of all branches of human knowledge, there is none
    which, like it [geometry] has sprung a completely armed Minerva
    from the head of Jupiter; none before whose death-dealing Aegis
    doubt and inconsistency have so little dared to raise their
    eyes. It escapes the tedious and troublesome task of collecting
    experimental facts, which is the province of the natural
    sciences in the strict sense of the word: the sole form of its
    scientific method is deduction. Conclusion is deduced from
    conclusion, and yet no one of common sense doubts but that
    these geometrical principles must find their practical
    application in the real world about us. Land surveying, as well
    as architecture, the construction of machinery no less than
    mathematical physics, are continually calculating relations of
    space of the most varied kinds by geometrical principles; they
    expect that the success of their constructions and experiments
    shall agree with their calculations; and no case is known in

    All such reasonings [natural philosophy,
    chemistry, agriculture, political economy, etc.] are, in
    comparison with mathematics, very complex; requiring so much
    <em>more</em> than that does, beyond the process of merely
    deducing the conclusion logically from the premises: so that it
    is no wonder that the longest mathematical demonstration should
    be much more easily constructed and understood, than a much
    shorter train of just reasoning concerning real facts. The
    former has been aptly compared to a long and steep, but even
    and regular, flight of steps, which tries the breath, and the
    strength, and the perseverance only; while the latter resembles
    a short, but rugged and uneven, ascent up a precipice, which
    requires a quick eye, agile limbs, and a firm step; and in
    which we have to tread now on this side, now on
    that—ever considering as we proceed, whether
    this or that projection will afford room for our foot, or
    whether some loose stone may not slide from under us. There are
    probably as many steps of pure reasoning in one of the longer

    The statement that a given individual has received
    a sound geometrical training implies that he has segregated
    from the whole of his sense impressions a certain set of these
    impressions, that he has eliminated from their consideration
    all irrelevant impressions (in other words, acquired a
    subjective command of these impressions), that he has developed
    on the basis of these impressions an ordered and continuous
    system of logical deduction, and finally that he is capable of
    expressing the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_302"
      id="Page_302">302</a></span>

    nature of these impressions and his
    deductions therefrom in terms simple and free from ambiguity.
    Now the slightest consideration will convince any one not
    already conversant with the idea, that the same sequence of
    mental processes underlies the whole career of any individual
    in any walk of life if only he is not concerned entirely with
    manual labor; consequently a full training in the performance
    of such sequences must be regarded as forming an essential part
    of any education worthy of the name. Moreover the full
    appreciation of such processes has a higher value than is
    contained in the mental training involved, great though this
    be, for it induces an appreciation of intellectual unity and
    beauty which plays for the mind that part which the
    appreciation of schemes of shape and color plays for the
    artistic faculties; or, again, that part which the appreciation
    of a body of religious doctrine plays for the ethical
    aspirations. Now geometry is not the sole possible basis for
    inculcating this appreciation. Logic is an alternative for
    adults, provided that the individual is possessed of sufficient
    wide, though rough, experience on which to base his reasoning.
    Geometry is, however, highly desirable in that the objective
    bases are so simple and precise that they can be grasped at an
    early age, that the amount of training for the imagination is
    very large, that the deductive processes are not beyond the
    scope of ordinary boys, and finally that it affords a better
    basis for exercise in the art of simple and exact expression
    than any other possible subject of a school
    course.—<span class="smcap">Carson, G. W. L.</span></p>

    but accurate and scientific habits of thought, and the courage
    to think that true which appears unlikely. And for supplying
    this want there is a special advantage in geometry, namely that
    it does not require study of a physically laborious kind, but
    rather that rapid intuition which women certainly possess; so
    that it is fit to become a scientific pursuit for

    We study art because we receive pleasure from the
    great works of the masters, and probably we appreciate them the
    more because we have dabbled a little in pigments or in clay.
    We do not expect to be composers, or poets, or sculptors, but
    we wish to appreciate music and letters and the fine arts, and
    to derive pleasure from them and be uplifted by them....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    So it is with geometry. We study it because we derive pleasure
    from contact with a great and ancient body of learning that has
    occupied the attention of master minds during the thousands of
    years in which it has been perfected, and we are uplifted by
    it. To deny that our pupils derive this pleasure from the study
    is to confess ourselves poor teachers, for most pupils do have
    positive enjoyment in the pursuit of geometry, in spite of the
    tradition that leads them to proclaim a general dislike for all
    study. This enjoyment is partly that of the
    game,—the playing of a game that can always
    be won, but that cannot be won too easily. It is partly that of
    the aesthetic, the pleasure of symmetry of form, the delight of
    fitting things together. But probably it lies chiefly in the
    mental uplift that geometry brings, the contact with absolute
    truth, and the approach that one makes to the Infinite. We are
    not quite sure of any one thing in biology; our knowledge of
    geology is relatively very slight, and the economic laws of
    society are uncertain to every one except some individual who
    attempts to set them forth; but before the world was fashioned
    the square on the hypotenuse was equal to the sum of the
    squares on the other two sides of a right triangle, and it will
    be so after this world is dead; and the inhabitant of Mars, if
    he exists, probably knows its truth as we know it. The uplift
    of this contact with absolute truth, with truth
    eternal,

<span class="pagenum">

      id="Page_306">306</a></span>

    gives pleasure to humanity to a
    greater or less degree, depending upon the mental equipment of
    the particular individual; but it probably gives an appreciable
    amount of pleasure to every student of geometry who has a
    teacher worthy of the name.—<span

    No other person can judge better of either [the
    merits of a writer and the merits of his works] than himself;
    for none have had access to a closer or more deliberate
    examination of them. It is for this reason, that in proportion
    that the value of a work is intrinsic, and independent of
    opinion, the less eagerness will the author feel to conciliate
    the suffrages of the public. Hence that inward satisfaction, so
    pure and so complete, which the study of geometry yields. The
    progress which an individual makes in this science, the degree
    of eminence which he attains in it, all this may be measured
    with the same rigorous accuracy as the methods about which his
    thoughts are employed. It is only when we entertain some doubts
    about the justness of our own standard, that we become anxious
    to relieve ourselves from our uncertainty, by comparing it with
    the standard of another. Now, in all matters which fall under
    the cognizance of taste, this standard is necessarily somewhat
    variable; depending on a sort of gross estimate, always a
    little arbitrary, either in whole or in part; and liable to
    continual alteration in its dimensions, from negligence,
    temper, or caprice. In consequence of these circumstances I
    have no doubt, that if men lived separate from each other, and
    could in such a situation occupy themselves about anything but
    self-preservation, they would prefer the study of the exact
    sciences to the cultivation of the agreeable arts. It is
    chiefly on account of others, that a man aims at excellence in
    the latter, it is on his own account that he devotes himself to
    the former. In a desert island, accordingly, I should think
    that a poet could scarcely be vain; whereas a geometrician

    affect the clearness, or the charm, of Geometrical truths. Such
    a theorem as “the square of the hypotenuse
    of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares
    of the sides” is as dazzlingly beautiful now as it was in the

    There are, undoubtedly, the most ample reasons for
    stating both the principles and theorems [of geometry] in their
    general form,.... But, that an unpractised learner, even in
    making use of one theorem to demonstrate another, reasons

    applying a theorem to a case in which the configuration of the
    diagram is extremely unlike that of the diagram by which the
    original theorem was demonstrated. A difficulty which, except
    in cases of unusual mental powers, long practice can alone
    remove, and removes chiefly by rendering us familiar with all

    The reason why I impute any defect to geometry,
    is, because its original and fundamental principles are
    deriv’d merely from appearances; and it may
    perhaps be imagin’d, that this defect must
    always attend it, and keep it from ever reaching a greater
    exactness in the comparison of objects or ideas, than what our
    eye or imagination alone is able to attain. I own that this
    defect so far attends it, as to keep it from ever aspiring to a
    full certainty. But since these fundamental principles depend
    on the easiest and least deceitful appearances, they bestow on

<span class="pagenum">

    I have already observed, that geometry, or the

    tho’ it much excels both in universality and
    exactness, the loose judgments of the senses and imagination;
    yet never attains a perfect precision and exactness. Its first

    All geometrical reasoning is, in the last resort,

    The description of right lines and circles, upon
    which Geometry is founded, belongs to Mechanics. Geometry does
    not teach us to draw these lines, but requires them to be
    drawn.... it requires that the learner should first be taught
    to describe these accurately, before he enters upon Geometry;
    then it shows how by these operations problems may be solved.
    To describe right lines and circles are problems, but not
    geometrical problems. The solution of these problems is
    required from Mechanics; by Geometry the use of them, when
    solved, is shown.... Therefore Geometry is founded in mechanical
    practice, and is nothing but that part of universal Mechanics
    which accurately proposes and demonstrates the art of measuring.
    But since the manual arts are chiefly conversant in the

    We must, then, admit ... that there is an

    science of physics, and that either of these may be treated by
    mathematical methods. Thus geometry becomes the simplest of the

    The reason why geometry is not so difficult as

    symbols employed. In algebra a general proposition respecting
    numbers is to be proved. Letters are taken which may represent
    any of the numbers in question, and the course of the
    demonstration, far from making use of a particular case, does
    not even allow that any reasoning, however general in its
    nature, is conclusive, unless the symbols are as general as the
    arguments.... In geometry on the contrary, at least in the
    elementary parts, any proposition may be safely demonstrated on
    reasonings on any one particular example.... It also affords

    The ancients, in the early days of the science,
    made great use of the graphic method, even in the form of
    construction; as when Aristarchus of Samos estimated the
    distance of the sun and moon from the earth on a triangle
    constructed as nearly as possible in resemblance to the
    right-angled triangle formed by the three bodies at the instant
    when the moon is in quadrature, and when therefore an
    observation of the angle at the earth would define the
    triangle. Archimedes himself, though he was the first to
    introduce calculated determinations into geometry, frequently
    used the same means. The introduction of trigonometry lessened
    the practice; but did not abolish it. The Greeks and Arabians
    employed it still for a great number of investigations for
    which we now consider the use of the Calculus
    indispensable.—<span class="smcap">Comte, A.</span></p>

    The grand use [of Descriptive Geometry] is in its
    application to the industrial arts;—its few
    abstract problems, capable of invariable solution, relating
    essentially to the contacts and intersections of surfaces; so
    that all the geometrical questions which may arise in any of
    the various arts of construction,—as
    stone-cutting, carpentry, perspective, dialing, fortification,
    etc.,—can always be treated as simple
    individual cases of a single theory, the solution being
    certainly obtainable through the particular circumstances of
    each case. This creation must be very important in the eyes of
    philosophers who think that all human achievement, thus far, is
    only a first step toward a philosophical renovation of the
    labours of mankind; towards that precision and logical
    character which can alone ensure the future progression of all
    arts.... Of Descriptive Geometry, it may further be said that
    it usefully exercises the student’s faculty
    of Imagination,—of conceiving of complicated
    geometrical combinations in space; and that, while it belongs
    to the geometry of the ancients by the character of its
    solutions, it approaches to the geometry of the moderns by the

    The pursuit of mathematics unfolds its formative

    subjects to analytical geometry. Unquestionably the simplest
    geometry and algebra already accustom the mind to sharp
    quantitative thinking, as also to assume as true only axioms
    and what has been proven. But the representation of functions
    by curves or surfaces reveals a new world of concepts and
    teaches the use of one of the most fruitful methods, which the
    human mind ever employed to increase its own effectiveness.

    It may be said that the conceptions of

    certainly go back to Archimedes, were introduced into science
    by the investigations of Kepler, Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat

    It appears that Fermat, the true inventor of the

    the calculus of finite differences by neglecting infinitesimals
    of higher orders as compared with those of a lower order....
    Newton, through his method of fluxions, has since rendered the
    calculus more analytical, he also simplified and generalized
    the method by the invention of his binomial theorem. Leibnitz
    has enriched the differential calculus by a very happy

    The difference between the method of
    infinitesimals and that of limits (when exclusively adopted)
    is, that in the latter it is usual to retain evanescent
    quantities of higher orders until the end of the calculation
    and then neglect them. On the other hand, such quantities are
    neglected from the commencement in the infinitesimal method,
    from the conviction that they cannot affect the final result,

    The essential merit, the sublimity, of the
    infinitesimal method lies in the fact that it is as easily
    performed as the simplest method of approximation, and that it
    is as accurate as the results of an ordinary calculation. This
    advantage would be lost, or at least greatly impaired, if,
    under the pretense of securing greater accuracy throughout the
    whole process, we were to substitute for the simpler method
    given by Leibnitz, one less convenient and less in harmony with

    of hyperbolic functions. Mercator’s

    continuity.... From him to our own day, the finest intellects
    of each generation in turn attacked these problems, but
    achieved broadly speaking nothing.... Weierstrass, Dedekind,
    and Cantor, ... have completely solved them. Their solutions
    ... are so clear as to leave no longer the slightest doubt of
    difficulty. This achievement is probably the greatest of which
    the age can boast.... The problem of the infinitesimal was
    solved by Weierstrass, the solution of the other two was begun
    by Dedekind and definitely accomplished by
    Cantor.—<span class="smcap">Russell, Bertrand.</span></p>

    The chief objection against all <em>abstract</em>
    reasonings is derived from the ideas of space and time; ideas,
    which, in common life and to a careless view, are very clear
    and intelligible, but when they pass through the scrutiny of
    the profound sciences (and they are the chief object of these
    sciences) afford principles, which seem full of obscurity and
    contradiction. No priestly <em>dogmas</em>, invented on purpose
    to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind, ever
    shocked common sense more than the doctrine of the infinite
    divisibility of extension, with its consequences; as they are
    pompously displayed by all geometricians and metaphysicians,
    with a kind of triumph and exultation. A real quantity,
    infinitely less than any finite quantity, containing quantities
    infinitely less than itself, and so on <em>in infinitum</em>;
    this is an edifice so bold and prodigious, that it is too
    weighty for any pretended demonstration to support, because it
    shocks the clearest and most natural principles of human
    reason. But what renders the matter more extraordinary, is,
    that these seemingly absurd opinions are supported by a chain
    of reasoning, the clearest and most natural; nor is it possible
    for us to allow the premises without admitting the
    consequences. Nothing can be more convincing and satisfactory
    than all the conclusions concerning the properties of circles
    and triangles; and yet, when these are once received, how can
    we deny, that the angle of contact between a circle and its
    tangent is infinitely less than any rectilineal angle, that as
    you may increase the diameter of the circle <em>in
    infinitum</em>, this angle of contact becomes still less, even
    <em>in infinitum</em>, and that the angle of contact between
    other curves and their tangents may be infinitely less than
    those between any circle and its tangent, and so on, <em>in
    infinitum</em>? The demonstration of these principles seems as
    unexceptionable as that which proves the three angles of a
    triangle to be equal to two right ones, though the latter

    to be thrown into a kind of amazement and suspense, which,
    without the suggestion of any sceptic, gives her a diffidence
    of herself, and of the ground on which she treads. She sees a
    full light, which illuminates certain places; but that light
    borders upon the most profound darkness. And between these she
    is so dazzled and confounded, that she scarcely can pronounce

    It is said that the minutest errors are not to be

    but only to the moments or nascent increments, whereof the
    proportion alone, and not the magnitude, is considered. And of
    the aforesaid fluxions there be other fluxions, which fluxions
    of fluxions are called second fluxions. And the fluxions of
    these second fluxions are called third fluxions: and so on,
    fourth, fifth, sixth, etc., <em>ad infinitum</em>. Now, as our
    Sense is strained and puzzled with the perception of objects

    derives from sense, is very much strained and puzzled to frame
    clear ideas of the least particle of time, or the least

    further the mind analyseth and pursueth these fugitive ideas
    the more it is lost and bewildered; the objects, at first
    fleeting and minute, soon vanishing out of sight. Certainly, in
    any sense, a second or third fluxion seems an obscure Mystery.

    in the ordinary acceptation of the words, or as capable of
    exact representation. They are introduced for the purpose of
    abridgment and simplification of our reasonings, and are an

    Moreover such quantities are
    neglected, not, as Leibnitz stated, because they are infinitely
    small in comparison with those that are retained, which would
    produce an infinitely small error, but because they must be
    neglected to obtain a rigorous result; since such result must
    be definite and determinate, and consequently independent of
    these <em>variable indefinitely small quantities</em>. It may be
    added that the precise principles of the infinitesimal
    calculus, like those of any other science, cannot be thoroughly

    sort of instinct for which ofttimes they are unable to account.
    If we consider the analytical methods to which this theory has
    given birth, the truth of the principles on which it is based,
    the fine and delicate logic which their employment in the
    solution of problems requires, the public utilities whose
    establishment rests upon it, the extension which it has
    received and which it may still receive through its application
    to the most important problems of natural philosophy and the
    moral sciences; if again we observe that, even in matters which
    cannot be submitted to the calculus, it gives us the surest
    suggestions for the guidance of our judgments, and that it
    teaches us to avoid the illusions which often mislead us, then
    we shall see that there is no science more worthy of our
    contemplations nor a more useful one for admission to our

    The difference between necessary and contingent

    involves an infinite process, and yet approaches a common

    Of all the applications of the doctrine of
    probability none is of greater utility than the theory of
    errors. In astronomy, geodesy, physics, and chemistry, as in
    every science which attains precision in measuring, weighing,
    and computing, a knowledge of the theory of errors is
    indispensable. By the aid of this theory the exact sciences
    have made great progress during the nineteenth century, not
    only in the actual determinations of the constants of nature,
    but also in the fixation of clear ideas as to the possibilities
    of future conquests in the same direction. Nothing, for
    example, is more satisfactory and instructive in the history of
    science than the success with which the unique method of least

      THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS, TIME AND SPACE</span></h2>

  <p class="v2">
    <b><a name="Block_2001" id="Block_2001">2001</a>.</b>
    Kant’s Doctrine of Time.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    I. Time is not an empirical concept deduced from any
    experience, for neither co-existence nor succession would enter
    into our perception, if the representation of time were not
    given <em>a priori</em>. Only when this representation <em>a
    priori</em> is given, can we imagine that certain things happen
    at the same time (simultaneously) or at different times
    (successively).</p>
  <p class="v1">
    II. Time is a necessary representation on which all intuitions
    depend. We cannot take away time from phenomena in general,
    though we can well take away phenomena out of time. In time
    alone is reality of phenomena possible. All phenomena may
    vanish, but time itself (as the general condition of their
    possibility) cannot be done away with.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    III. On this <em>a priori</em> necessity depends also the
    possibility of apodictic principles of the relations of time,
    or of axioms of time in general. Time has one dimension only;
    different times are not simultaneous, but successive, while
    different spaces are never successive, but simultaneous. Such
    principles cannot be derived from experience, because
    experience could not impart to them absolute universality nor
    apodictic certainty....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    IV. Time is not a discursive, or what is called a general
    concept, but a pure form of sensuous intuition. Different times
    are parts only of one and the same time....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    V. To say that time is infinite means no more than that every
    definite quantity of time is possible only by limitations of
    one time which forms the foundation of all times. The original
    representation of time must therefore be given as unlimited.
    But when the parts themselves and every quantity of an object
    can be represented as determined by limitation only, the whole
    representation cannot be given by concepts (for in that case
    the partial representation comes first), but must be founded on
    immediate intuition.—<span class="smcap">Kant, I.</span></p>

  <p class="v2">
    <b><a name="Block_2002" id="Block_2002">2002</a>.</b>
    Kant’s Doctrine of Space.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    I. Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived
    from external experience. For in order that certain sensations
    should be referred to something outside myself, i.e. to
    something in a different part of space from that where I am;
    again, in order that I may be able to represent them as side by
    side, that is, not only as different, but as in different
    places, the representation of space must already be there....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    II. Space is a necessary representation <em>a priori</em>,
    forming the very foundation of all external intuitions. It is
    impossible to imagine that there should be no space, though one
    might very well imagine that there should be space without
    objects to fill it. Space is therefore regarded as a condition
    of the possibility of phenomena, not as a determination
    produced by them; it is a representation <em>a priori</em> which
    necessarily precedes all external phenomena.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    III. On this necessity of an <em>a priori</em> representation of
    space rests the apodictic certainty of all geometrical
    principles, and the possibility of their construction <em>a
    priori</em>. For if the intuition of space were a concept gained
    <em>a posteriori</em>, borrowed from general external experience,
    the first principles of mathematical definition would be
    nothing but perceptions. They would be exposed to all the
    accidents of perception, and there being but one straight line
    between two points would not be a necessity, but only something
    taught in each case by experience. Whatever is derived from
    experience possesses a relative generality only, based on
    induction. We should therefore not be able to say more than
    that, so far as hitherto observed, no space has yet been found
    having more than three dimensions.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    IV. Space is not a discursive or so-called general concept of
    the relations of things in general, but a pure intuition. For,
    first of all, we can imagine one space only, and if we speak of
    many spaces, we mean parts only of one and the same space. Nor
    can these parts be considered as antecedent to the one and
    all-embracing space and, as it were, its component parts out of
    which an aggregate is formed, but they can be thought of as
    existing within it only. Space is essentially one; its
    multiplicity, and therefore the general concept of spaces in
    general, arises entirely from limitations. Hence it follows
    that, with respect to

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_347"
      id="Page_347">347</a></span>

    space, an intuition <em>a
    priori</em>, which is not empirical, must form the foundation of
    all conceptions of space....</p>
  <p class="v1">
    V. Space is represented as an infinite given quantity. Now it
    is quite true that every concept is to be thought as a
    representation, which is contained in an infinite number of
    different possible representations (as their common
    characteristic), and therefore comprehends them: but no
    concept, as such, can be thought as if it contained in itself
    an infinite number of representations. Nevertheless, space is
    so thought (for all parts of infinite space exist
    simultaneously). Consequently, the original representation of
    space is an <em>intuition a priori</em>, and not a
    concept.—<span class="smcap">Kant, I.</span></p>

    If the Euclidean assumptions are true, the
    constitution of those parts of space which are at an infinite
    distance from us, “geometry upon the plane
    at infinity,” is just as well known as the geometry
    of any portion of this room. In this infinite and thoroughly
    well-known space the Universe is situated during at least some
    portion of an infinite and thoroughly well-known time. So that
    here we have real knowledge of something at least that concerns
    the Cosmos; something that is true throughout the Immensities
    and the Eternities. That something Lobatchewsky and his
    successors have taken away. The geometer of to-day knows
    nothing about the nature of the actually existing space at an
    infinite distance; he knows nothing about the properties of
    this present space in a past or future eternity. He knows,
    indeed, that the laws assumed by Euclid are true with an
    accuracy that no direct experiment can approach, not only in
    this place where we are, but in places at a distance from us
    that no astronomer has conceived; but he knows this as of Here

    I am exceedingly sorry that I have failed to avail

    but little time for this purpose); though the course which I
    have pursued does not lead as much to the desired end, which
    you assure me you have reached, as to the questioning of the
    truth of geometry. It is true that I have found much which many
    would accept as proof, but which in my estimation proves
    <em>nothing</em>, for instance, if it could be shown that a
    rectilinear triangle is possible, whose area is greater than
    that of any given surface, then I could rigorously establish
    the whole of geometry. Now most people, no doubt, would grant
    this as an axiom, but not I; it is conceivable that, however
    distant apart the vertices of the triangle might be chosen, its
    area might yet

    On the supposition that Euclidean geometry is not valid, it is
    easy to show that similar figures do not exist; in that case
    the angles of an equilateral triangle vary with the
    side in which I see no absurdity at all. The angle is a
    function of the side and the sides are functions of the angle,
    a function which, of course, at the same time involves a
    constant length. It seems somewhat of a paradox to say that a
    constant length could be given a priori as it were, but in this
    again I see nothing inconsistent. Indeed, it would be desirable
    that Euclidean geometry were not valid, for then we should

    insights into the nature of space which at present are

    There is no doubt that it can be rigorously
    established that the sum of the angles of a rectilinear
    triangle cannot exceed 180&deg;. But it is otherwise
    with the statement that the sum of the angles cannot be less
    than 180&deg;; this is the real Gordian knot, the rocks
    which cause the wreck of all.... I have been occupied with the
    problem over thirty years and I doubt if anyone has given it
    more serious attention, though I have never published anything
    concerning it. The assumption that the angle sum is less than
    180&deg; leads to a peculiar geometry, entirely
    different from the Euclidean, but throughout consistent
    with itself. I have developed this
    geometry to my own satisfaction

    so that I can solve every
    problem that arises in it with the exception of the
    determination of a certain constant which cannot be determined
    a priori. The larger one assumes this constant the more nearly
    one approaches the Euclidean geometry, an infinitely large
    value makes the two coincide. The theorems of this geometry
    seem in part paradoxical, and to the unpracticed absurd; but on
    a closer and calm reflection it is found that in themselves
    they contain nothing impossible.... All my efforts to discover
    some contradiction, some inconsistency in this Non-Euclidean
    geometry have been fruitless, the one thing in it that seems
    contrary to reason is that space would have to contain a
    <em>definitely determinate</em> (though to us unknown) linear
    magnitude. However, it seems to me that notwithstanding the
    meaningless word-wisdom of the metaphysicians we know really
    too little, or nothing, concerning the true nature of space to
    confound what appears unnatural with the <em>absolutely
    impossible.</em> Should Non-Euclidean geometry be true, and this
    constant bear some relation to magnitudes which come within the
    domain of terrestrial or celestial measurement, it could be

    cannot be completely established on a priori grounds. In the
    mean time I shall probably not for a long time yet put my
    <em>very extended</em> investigations concerning this matter in
    shape for publication, possibly not while I live, for I fear
    the cry of the Bœotians which would arise should I
    express my whole view on this matter.—It is
    curious too, that besides the known gap in
    Euclid’s geometry, to fill which all efforts
    till now have been in vain, and which will never be filled,
    there exists another defect, which to my knowledge no one thus
    far has criticised and which (though possible) it is by no
    means easy to remove. This is the definition of a plane as a
    surface which wholly contains the line joining any

        id="Page_357">357</a></span>

    two
    points. This definition contains more than is necessary to the
    determination of the surface, and tacitly involves a theorem
    which demands proof.—<span class="smcap">Gauss.</span></p>

    I will add that I have recently received from
    Hungary a little paper on Non-Euclidean geometry, in which I
    rediscover all <em>my own ideas</em> and <em>results</em> worked
    out with great elegance,.... The writer is a very young
    Austrian officer, the son of one of my early friends, with whom
    I often discussed the subject in 1798, although my ideas were
    at that time far removed from the development and maturity
    which they have received through the original reflections of
    this young man. I consider the young geometer v. Bolyai a
    genius of the first rank.—<span class="smcap">Gauss.</span></p>

    Think of the image of the world in a convex
    mirror.... A well-made convex mirror of moderate aperture
    represents the objects in front of it as apparently solid and
    in fixed positions behind its surface. But the images of the
    distant horizon and of the sun in the sky lie behind the mirror
    at a limited distance, equal to its focal length. Between these
    and the surface of the mirror are found the images of all the
    other objects before it, but the images are diminished and
    flattened in proportion to the distance of their objects from
    the mirror.... Yet every straight line or plane in the outer
    world is represented by a straight [?] line or plane in the
    image. The image of a man measuring with a rule a straight line
    from the mirror, would contract more and more the farther he
    went, but with his shrunken rule the man in the image would
    count out exactly the same number of centimeters as the real
    man. And, in general, all geometrical measurements of lines and
    angles made with regularly varying images of real instruments
    would yield exactly the same results as in the outer world, all
    lines of sight in the mirror would be represented by straight
    lines of sight in the mirror. In short, I do not see how men in
    the mirror are to discover that their bodies are not rigid
    solids and their experiences good examples of the correctness
    of Euclidean axioms.

    But if they could look out upon
    our world as we look into theirs without overstepping the
    boundary, they must declare it to be a picture in a spherical
    mirror, and would speak of us just as we speak of them; and if
    two inhabitants of the different worlds could communicate with
    one another, neither, as far as I can see, would be able to
    convince the other that he had the true, the other the
    distorted, relation. Indeed I cannot see that such a question
    would have any meaning at all, so long as mechanical
    considerations are not mixed up with

    That space conceived of as a locus of points has
    but three dimensions needs no argument from the mathematical
    point of view; but just as little can we from this point of
    view prevent the assertion that space has really four or an
    infinite number of dimensions though we perceive only three.
    The theory of multiply-extended manifolds, which enters more
    and more into the foreground of mathematical research, is from
    its very nature perfectly independent of such an assertion. But
    the form of expression, which this theory employs, has indeed
    grown out of this conception. Instead of referring to the
    individuals of a manifold, we speak of the points of a higher
    space, etc. In itself this form of expression has many
    advantages, in that it facilitates comprehension by calling up
    geometrical intuition. But it has this disadvantage, that in
    extended circles, investigations concerning manifolds of any
    number of dimensions are considered singular alongside the
    above-mentioned conception of space. This view is without the
    least foundation. The investigations in question would indeed
    find immediate geometric applications if the conception were
    valid but its value and purpose, being independent of this
    conception, rests upon its essential mathematical
    content.—<span class="smcap">Klein, F.</span></p>

    We are led naturally to extend the language of
    geometry to the case of any number of variables, still using
    the word <em>point</em> to designate any system of values of n
    variables (the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_359"
      id="Page_359">359</a></span>

    coördinates of the
    point), the word <em>space</em> (of n dimensions) to designate
    the totality of all these points or systems of values,
    <em>curves</em> or <em>surface</em> to designate the spread
    composed of points whose coördinates are given
    functions (with the proper restrictions) of one or two
    parameters (the <em>straight line</em> or <em>plane</em>, when they
    are linear fractional functions with the same denominator),
    etc. Such an extension has come to be a necessity in a large
    number of investigations, in order as well to give them the
    greatest generality as to preserve in them the intuitive
    character of geometry. But it has been noted that in such use
    of geometric language we are no longer constructing truly a
    geometry, for the forms that we have been considering are
    essentially analytic, and that, for example, the general
    projective geometry constructed in this way is in substance
    nothing more than the algebra of linear
    transformations.—<span class="smcap">Segre, Corradi.</span></p>

    may be, none of them may be, not all of them can be, valid in

    terse, sensuous, artistic, stimulating language of geometry. On
    the other hand, the hyperspaces are in themselves immeasurably

    When a paradoxer parades capital letters and

    all who know nothing about it, some persons wonder why science
    does not rise and triturate the whole thing. This is why: all
    who are fit to read the refutation are satisfied already, and
    can, if they please, detect the paradoxer for themselves. Those
    who are not fit to do this would not know the difference

    Montucla says, speaking of France, that he finds
    three notions prevalent among cyclometers: 1. That there is a
    large reward offered for success; 2. That the longitude problem
    depends on that success; 3. That the solution is the great end
    and object of geometry. The same three notions are equally
    prevalent among the same class in England. No reward has ever
    been offered by the government of either country. The longitude
    problem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing
    approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond
    what can be wanted. And geometry, content with what exists, has
    long passed on to other matters. Sometimes a cyclometer
    persuades a skipper who has made land in the wrong place that
    the astronomers are at fault, for using a wrong measure of the
    circle; and the skipper thinks it a very comfortable solution!
    And this is the utmost that the problem has to do with
    longitude.—<span class="smcap">De Morgan, A.</span></p>

    an axiom:</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Prop. If the sum of the interior angles ECF and DBC which two

    Proof. Construct PCA equal to the supplement PBD of CBD, and
    ECF, FCG, etc. each equal to ACE, so that ACF = 2.ACE, ACG =
    3.ACE, etc. Then however small the angle ACE may be, there
    exists some number n such that n.ACE = ACH will be equal to or
    greater than ACP.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Again, take BI, IL, etc. each equal to CB, and draw IK, LM,
    etc. parallel to BD, then the figures ACBD, DBIK, KILM, etc.
    are congruent, and ACIK = 2.ABCD, ACLM = 3.ACBD, etc.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    Take ACNO = n.ACBD, n having the same value as in the
    expression ACH = n.ACE, then ACNO is certainly less than ACP,
    since ACNO must be increased by ONP to be equal to ACP. It
    follows that ACNO is also less than ACH, and by taking the nth
    part of each of these, that ACBD is less than ACE.</p>
  <p class="v1">

    otherwise ACE would be a part of ACBD.</p>

    which received the endorsement of a well-known New York school

    What distinguishes the straight line and circle
    more than anything else, and properly separates them for the
    purpose of elementary geometry? Their self-similarity. Every
    inch of a straight line coincides with every other inch, and
    off a circle with every other off the same circle. Where, then,
    did Euclid fail? In not introducing the third curve, which has
    the same property—the <em>screw</em>. The
    right line, the circle, the screw—the
    representations of translation, rotation, and the two
    combined—ought to have been the instruments
    of geometry. With a screw we should never have heard of the

    At last we entered the palace, and proceeded into
    the chamber of presence where I saw the king seated on his
    throne,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_370"
      id="Page_370">370</a></span>

    attended on each side by persons of
    prime quality. Before the throne, was a large table filled with
    globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all kinds.
    His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our
    entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of
    all persons belonging to the court. But he was then deep in a
    problem, and we attended an hour, before he could solve it.
    There stood by him, on each side, a young page with flaps in
    their hands, and when they saw he was at leisure, one of them
    gently struck his mouth, and the other his right ear; at which
    he started like one awaked on the sudden, and looking toward me
    and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of our
    coming, whereof he had been informed before. He spake some
    words, whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came to my
    side, and flapt me gently on the right ear, but I made signs,
    as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an
    instrument; which, as I afterwards found, gave his majesty, and
    the whole court, a very mean opinion of my understanding. The
    king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several questions,
    and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had. When
    it was found, that I could neither understand nor be
    understood, I was conducted by his order to an apartment in his
    palace, (this prince being distinguished above all his
    predecessors, for his hospitality to strangers) where two
    servants were appointed to attend me. My dinner was brought,
    and four persons of quality, did me the honour to dine with me.
    We had two courses of three dishes each. In the first course,
    there was a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral
    triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides, and a pudding into
    a cycloid. The second course, was, two ducks trussed up in the
    form of fiddles; sausages and puddings, resembling flutes and
    haut-boys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp. The
    servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms,
    and several other mathematical
    figures.—<span class="smcap">Swift, Jonathan.</span></p>

    assistance in acquiring their phraseology, which depended much
    upon that science, and music; and in the latter I was not

    circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms,
    or by words of art drawn from music, needless here to repeat. I

    I was at the mathematical school, where the master
    taught his pupils, after a method, scarce imaginable to us in
    Europe. The propositions, and demonstrations, were fairly
    written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of a cephalic
    tincture. This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting
    stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread
    and water. As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his
    brain, bearing the proposition along with it. But the success
    has not hitherto been answerable, partly by some error in the
    <em>quantum</em> or composition, and partly by the perverseness
    of lads; to whom this bolus is so nauseous, that they generally
    steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can operate;

    It is worth observing that some of those who
    disparage some branch of study in which they are deficient,
    will often affect more contempt for it than they really feel.
    And not unfrequently they will take pains to have it thought
    that they are themselves well versed in it, or that they easily
    might be, if they thought it worth while;—in
    short, that it is not from hanging too high that the grapes are

    Thus, Swift, in the person of Gulliver, represents himself,
    while deriding the extravagant passion for Mathematics among
    the Laputians, as being a good mathematician. Yet he betrays
    his utter ignorance, by speaking “of a
    pudding in the <em>form of a cycloid</em>:” evidently
    taking the cycloid for a <em>figure</em>, instead of a

    It is natural to think that an abstract science
    cannot be of much importance in the affairs of human life,
    because it has omitted from its consideration everything of
    real interest. It will be remembered that Swift, in his
    description of Gulliver’s voyage to Laputa,
    is of two minds on this point. He describes the mathematicians
    of that country as silly and useless dreamers, whose attention
    has to be awakened by flappers. Also, the mathematical tailor
    measures his height by a quadrant, and deduces his other
    dimensions by a rule and compasses, producing a suit of very

    In view of the fact that the offered prize [for

    Greater Theorem] is about $25,000 and that lack of marginal
    space in his copy of Diophantus was the reason given by Fermat
    for not communicating his proof, one might be tempted to wish
    that one could send credit for a dime back through the ages to
    Fermat and thus secure this coveted prize, if it actually
    existed. This might, however, result more seriously than one
    would at first suppose; for if Fermat had bought on credit a
    dime’s worth of paper even during the year
    of his death, 1665, and if this bill had been drawing compound
    interest at the rate of six per cent, since that time, the bill

    <em>If the Indians hadn’t spent

    Netherland, purchased Manhattan Island from the Indians for
    about $24. The rate of interest on money is higher in new
    countries, and gradually decreases as wealth accumulates.
    Within the present generation the legal rate in the state has
    fallen from 7% to 6%. Assume for simplicity a uniform rate of
    7% from 1626 to the present, and suppose that the Indians had
    put their $24 at interest at that rate (banking facilities in
    New York being always taken for granted!) and had added the
    interest to the principal yearly. What would be the amount now,

    The Pythagoreans and Platonists were carried
    further by this love of simplicity. Pythagoras, by his skill in
    mathematics, discovered that there can be no more than five
    regular solid figures, terminated by plane surfaces which are
    all similar and equal; to wit, the tetrahedron, the cube, the
    octahedron, the dodecahedron, and the eicosihedron. As nature
    works in the most simple and regular way, he thought that all
    elementary bodies must have one or other of those regular
    figures; and that the discovery of the properties and relations
    of the regular solids must be a key to open the mysteries of
    nature.</p>
  <p class="v1">
    This notion of the Pythagoreans and Platonists has undoubtedly
    great beauty and simplicity. Accordingly it prevailed, at least
    to the time of Euclid. He was a Platonic philosopher, and is
    said to have wrote all the books of his Elements, in order to
    discover the properties and relations of the five regular
    solids. The ancient tradition of the intention of Euclid in
    writing his elements, is countenanced by the work itself. For
    the last book of the elements treats of the regular solids, and
    all the preceding are subservient to the
    last.—<span class="smcap">Reid, Thomas.</span></p>

    In the Timæus [of Plato] it is

    forms of these [the regular] solids. Fire has the Pyramid;
    Earth has the Cube; Water the Octahedron; Air the Icosahedron;
    and the Dodecahedron is the plan of the Universe itself. It was
    natural that when Plato had learnt that other mathematical
    properties had a bearing upon the constitution of the Universe,
    he should suppose that the

    will be the orbit of Saturn. Now inscribe in the

    It will not be thought surprising that Plato
    expected that Astronomy, when further advanced, would be able
    to render an account of many things for which she has not
    accounted even to this day. Thus, in the passage in the seventh
    Book of the <em>Republic</em>, he says that the philosopher
    requires a reason for the proportion of the day to the month,
    and the month to the year, deeper and more substantial than
    mere observation can give. Yet Astronomy has not yet shown us
    any reason why the proportion of the times of the
    earth’s rotation on its axis, the
    moon’s revolution round the earth, and the
    earth’s revolution round the sun, might not
    have been made by the Creator quite different from what they
    are. But in asking Mathematical Astronomy for reasons which she
    cannot give, Plato was only doing what a great astronomical
    discoverer, Kepler, did at a later period. One of the questions
    which Kepler especially wished to have answered was, why there
    are five planets, and why at such particular distances from the
    sun? And it is still more curious that he thought he had found
    the reason of these things, in the relation of those five
    regular solids which Plato was desirous of introducing into the
    philosophy of the universe....

    beatitude, resulting from the creature, which makes seven with
    the Trinity, which is three: therefore
    it is that God’s commandments

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_380"
      id="Page_380">380</a></span>

    are ten in
    number. The number eleven denotes sin, because it
    <em>transgresses</em> ten.... This number seventy-seven is the
    product of eleven, figuring sin, multiplied by seven, and not
    by ten, for seven is the number of the creature. Three
    represents the soul, which is in some sort an image of
    Divinity; and four represents the body, on account of its four
    qualities....—<span class="smcap">St. Augustine.</span></p>

    Stifel, the most acute and original of the early
    mathematicians of Germany, ... relates ... that whilst a monk
    at Esslingen in 1520, and when infected by the writings of
    Luther, he was reading in the library of his convent the 13th
    Chapter of <em>Revelations</em>, it struck his mind that the
    <em>Beast</em> must signify the Pope, Leo X.; He then proceeded
    in pious hope to make the calculation of the sum of the numeral
    letters in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leo decimus</i>,
    which he found to be M, D, C, L,
    V, I; the sum which these formed was too great by M, and too
    little by X; but he

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_381"

    bethought him again, that he has seen
    the name written Leo X., and that there were ten letters in
    <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leo decimus</i>, from either
    of which he could obtain the
    deficient number, and by interpreting the M to mean
    <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mysterium</i>, he found the
    number required, a discovery
    which gave him such unspeakable comfort, that he believed that
    his interpretation must have been an immediate inspiration of
    God.—<span class="smcap">Peacock, George.</span></p>

    impersonating youthful heroes. Each

    letters of the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus
    Lescinia</i>. At the end of the
    first dance the children were so arranged that the letters on
    their shields spelled the words <i lang="la"

    end of the second dance they read: <i lang="la"

    There is a certain spiral of a peculiar form on
    which a point may have been approaching for centuries the
    center, and have nearly reached it, before we discover that its
    rate of approach is accelerated. The first thought of the
    observer, on seeing the acceleration, would be to say that it
    would reach the center sooner than he had before supposed. But
    as the point comes near the center it suddenly, although still
    moving under the same simple law as from the beginning, makes a
    very short turn upon its path and flies off rapidly almost in a
    straight line,

    One of the most remarkable of
    Babbage’s illustrations of miracles has
    never had the consideration in the popular mind which it
    deserves; the illustration drawn from the existence of isolated
    points fulfilling the equation of a curve.... There are
    definitions of curves which describe not only the positions of
    every point in a certain curve, but also of one or more
    perfectly isolated points; and if we should attempt to get by
    induction the definition, from the observation of the points on
    the curve, we might fail altogether to include these isolated
    points; which, nevertheless, although standing alone, as
    miracles to the observer of the course of the points in the
    curve, are nevertheless rigorously included in the law of the
